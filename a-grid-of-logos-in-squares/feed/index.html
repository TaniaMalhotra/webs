					<description><![CDATA[Cool article, I have missed only one thing (something I had to deal with in the past).

These logos you were using are all wide and short. But what if you have to put logos of varied aspect ratios in a grid? Just imagine a few square-ish logos there, maybe some tall?]]></description>

Absolutely should use &lt;code&gt;&#060;ul&#062;&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;&#060;li&#062;&lt;/code&gt;s. What we have here is a list of logos. They might be displayed as a grid, but it&#039;s clearly a list. A user who can see will know immediately how many there are, as it&#039;s visually obvious, and visual information is generally processed much, much faster than audio information is by people. A user relying on a screen reader will not, until their reader has got to the end and if they&#039;ve kept count.

Also, as it won&#039;t affect the visual representation, it&#039;s a zero-sum game.]]></description>

This wouldn&#039;t work. The image need to be on top of the pseudo element]]></description>

You certainly could use an unordered list! I guess that would announce how many logos are there to a screen reader user if you think that would matter to them. Probably better would be to ask your screen reader users if they think that is important to know. It doesn&#039;t seem overly important to me, but I&#039;m not a screen reader user. If the order of them mattered, you&#039;ve got ordered lists as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just curious on the use of &lt;code&gt;&#060;div&#062;&lt;/code&gt;s here. Wouldn&#039;t it be more prudent/semantic to use a &lt;code&gt;&#060;ul&#062;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#060;li&#062;&lt;/code&gt;s for the grid items?

Also, for me in Chrome (on Windows) the images drag at the same width/height as they are in the grid, so no weirdly exploding dimensions. Looks to be a browser quirk that one.]]></description>

I covered a couple different ways, especially in &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/179-a-grid-of-squares/&quot;&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;. Absolute positioning is one of them. Grid is another. Since the whole thing is grid, I prefer the the grid solution, but you&#039;re right, flexbox is also capable of centering things nicely.]]></description>
