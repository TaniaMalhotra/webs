Wow @CanRu. Phablets with pens are always a tricky scenario. If you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;d like to ask a couple more usability questions about this element. You can reach me on twitter @a_sandrina_p or by e-mail a.sandrina.p@gmail.com]]></description>

I&#039;m using latest Chrome on Samsung Note 8 and get the custom one instead of the native.
It works okay enough, I can select etc yet I thought I mention it as it&#039;s not what I expected.
So maybe the Note has hover support because of the stylus ✍️‍♂️]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The implementation uses a genius combination of a hover media query and an adjacent sibling selector in CSS. It has been tested on a number of device/platform/browser combinations but more tests are welcome!
  
  What I love about this solution is that it satisfies the stakeholders insisting on a custom component but doesn’t abandon all the built-in accessibility that you get from native form controls
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

That&#039;s where the &lt;code&gt;@media (hover: hover)&lt;/code&gt; comes into action. It works well in all major/recent browsers. In other words, none of the mobile browsers matched that media query, which means the custom select stayed hidden there. And in an old browser, the native select will be shown as well.]]></description>

Thank you Daniel for your feedback! I may confess this exact part was the most uncertain to write about. Even after reading the official documentation and examples over and over again. However, as you said (and to play it safe), there&#039;s nothing wrong in informing the user about the change :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One more observation. It would be nice to detect mobile browsers.

					<description><![CDATA[Sorting isn&#039;t actually a big enough change to constitute a change in context.

Change in &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; != change in &lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt;.

See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change.html#consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change-examples-head&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;second example under on input&lt;/a&gt;.

A change of context is like going from the about page to the contact page, opening a new window, or shifting the current focus point to another element.
(See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#context-changedef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;official definition for &quot;change of context&quot;&lt;/a&gt;)

If you are using a &lt;code&gt;&#060;select&#062;&lt;/code&gt; as your primary navigation, that is inaccessible.

If you are just using it to sort a list of news articles immediately on change though, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; accessible.

It probably doesn&#039;t hurt warning the user about the immediate effect though anyway.]]></description>
