					<description><![CDATA[<p>It looks like a little bit of magic to watch a shape draw itself on the web. Or like it's probably an embedded video. But it doesn't have to be! In fact, with remarkably little code and an awfully clever technique involving stroke dashes and offsets, we can do it on any SVG path.  		</p>

But that swap can be visually rough with lots of abrupt shifts and reflow. We can fix that though!  		</p>
