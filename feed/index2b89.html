<h3>Our Guide to Responsive Images Syntax in HTML</h3>



<p>Here’s one for your bookmarks: if you’ve ever wondered if you’re using the correct responsive images syntax in HTML then <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/">our guide was made just for you</a>. In the intro, Chris writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This guide is about the <strong>HTML syntax</strong> for responsive images (and a little bit of CSS for good measure). The responsive images syntax is about serving <strong>one image</strong> from multiple options based on rules and circumstances. There are two forms of responsive images, and they’re for two different things:<br/><br/>1) If your only goal is <strong>performance</strong>, then what you need is…<code>&lt;img srcset="" src="" alt=""&gt;</code><br/>2) If you also need <strong>design control</strong>, then what you need is…  <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?fit=1024%2C545&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312908" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?w=3464&amp;ssl=1 3464w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?resize=1024%2C545&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?resize=768%2C408&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?resize=1536%2C817&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?resize=2048%2C1089&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?resize=1000%2C532&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-6.34.03-PM.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/><figcaption>Check out the “Only View Code Snippets” button if you’re there just to snag some code quick.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The syntax for getting responsive images right can be tricky sometimes and so I’m extremely glad that now I have a resource I can return to again and again whenever I need it. </p>

<h3>Striking a balance between native and custom elements</h3>



<p>It can be pretty difficult to style a native <code>select</code> element and make sure that it’s accessible for as many folks as possible, as well as matching the visuals of your website and design system. This is because that element is still rather difficult to style today but also because by default browsers will do a lot of hard work for us; keyboard access, respecting user preferences, and good support for screen readers too.</p>



<p>So: if we want to make a <code>select</code> that is not only just visually nice but also meets all the common usability standards of a native <code>select</code> then we have some work ahead of us.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?fit=1024%2C509&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312903" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?w=1784&amp;ssl=1 1784w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?resize=1024%2C509&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?resize=768%2C382&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?resize=1536%2C764&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-5-1.png?resize=1000%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>But! Thankfully Sandrina Pereira has written <a href="https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/">this fantastic post</a> all about the concerns we need to take into account when making a custom <code>select</code>. But Sandrina’s idea is basically to use both types of select: the native one for accessibility and the fancy visual one for mouse-based users:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When we build a simple custom select, we are making a trade-off without noticing it. Specifically, <strong>we sacrifice functionality to aesthetics. </strong>It should be the other way around.</p><p>What if we instead deliver a native select by default and replace it with a more aesthetically pleasing one if possible? That’s where the “hybrid” select idea comes into action. It’s “hybrid” because it consists of two selects, showing the appropriate one at the right moment:</p><p>• A native select, visible and accessible by default<br/>• A custom select, hidden until it’s safe to be interacted with a mouse</p></blockquote>



<p>This trick isn’t that complicated at all — it requires detecting whether hover is supported with a media query and toggling the visibility of the fancy custom select element when that’s available. Pretty neat trick, I’d say.</p>

<h3>This <code>z-index</code> visualization tool is nice</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Have you always found the concept of <code>z-index</code> tricky? Did you give a <code>z-index</code> value of 99999 to a HTML element hoping it will be placed in front of everything in a page and it still didn’t work? If your answer is yes, you’ve come to the right place.</p></blockquote>



<p>That’s Thiru Manikandan writing about <a href="https://thirumanikandan.com/posts/learn-z-index-using-a-visualization-tool">the difficulties of z-index</a> where he’s made some great demos that show why a ton of us probably get confused by z-index at one point or another. This stuff is typically known as the stacking context and a lot of things can impact it—one of the least obvious being the structure of your markup. So this post is definitely worth reading if you’re ever stuck and in z-index hell. </p>

<h3>CUBE CSS</h3>



<p>Last month Andy Bell wrote about how he likes to writes CSS with a new method that he calls CUBE CSS and in <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/">the post all about the subject</a> he writes about why he finds it just so dang helpful:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>CUBE stands for <strong>Composition Utility Block Exception</strong>, and CSS stands for, y’know, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). As mentioned before, the CUBE methodology is very much an <strong>extension</strong> of good ol’ CSS, rather than a reinvention. This mantra is very seriously maintained too, as the cascade and inheritance particularity play a big role.</p></blockquote>



<p>Andy breaks down each section of what this methodology entails but let’s jump straight to the good bit. What does this look like when it’s applied to HTML? Andy’s example looks like this:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;article
  class="[ card ] [ section box ] [ bg-base color-primary ]"
  data-state="reversed"
&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</code></pre>



<p>So each category of CUBE is broken up into different groups that are separated by brackets, just like they are above — and I sort of love this! It’s pretty clear even if you don’t understand what CUBE means that each group of these classes have a specific function. And I think it’s pretty clear that the last section above are utility classes that update the classes of the base class, like <code>.card</code>.</p>



<p>Overall I’m excited to see Andy write more about this technique because lately I’ve been working on an app that heavily uses <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">emotion</a>—and if I’m entirely honest I don’t think it’s a big improvement over using something like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/">CSS Modules.</a></p>

<h3>Add IDs to your header elements, that is an order!</h3>



<p>Okay, so I’ve had too much coffee, yes. But! I always love it when a site—particularly a documentation heavy website—uses IDs on heading elements so that I can link other people to the specific part of the document that I want to make note of. It’s an extremely small nice-to-have that always makes my life a tiny bit easier.</p>



<p>Anyway, Chris wrote up some notes on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-adding-ids-to-headers/">adding IDs to headers</a> and mentions that you don’t have to write HTML to do this, you can also write some JavaScript to do the heavy lifting for you, which is neat.</p>

<h3>Creative Background Patterns Using Gradients, CSS Shapes, and Even Emojis</h3>



<p>Lately on the web I’ve noticed a distinct lack of cool backgrounds made with CSS. So here’s a post that details how we can remedy that  because there’s a ton of fancy ways to go about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creative-background-patterns-using-gradients-css-shapes-and-even-emojis/">making rad backgrounds with CSS</a>. We can use SVG and emojis, gradients—both linear and conic, and then we can even show off by using gradients on emojis that are also SVGs. The mind reels!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-5.21.16-PM.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312906" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-5.21.16-PM.png?w=638&amp;ssl=1 638w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-14-at-5.21.16-PM.png?resize=287%2C300&amp;ssl=1 287w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>There has been one case lately of a website that I think has a rather beautiful background pattern and that’s from the ever-so-weird archive that is <a href="https://dreamwiki.sixey.es/welcome.dream/">Dream Wiki</a>. This is a website that defines words in a rather curious way but, however you might feel about the descriptions themselves, there is something lovely about the use of punctuation-as-background here:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dream-wiki.png?fit=392%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312907" width="560" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dream-wiki.png?resize=115%2C300&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dream-wiki.png?resize=392%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 392w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Each time you refresh the page you’ll find a new background and I’m not entirely sure how it’s made but you can select the punctuation in the background which probably isn’t so great for accessibility. Either way though, this is a neat idea. More rad backgrounds please!</p>

<h3>5 Myths about Jamstack</h3>



<p>It seems like there’s a lot of myths about Jamstack these days, I see quite a lot of criticism on Twitter and the ol’ blogosphere and I’ve never had an issue with it. I love everything that the Jamstack offers and I like that this technique for making websites has a name because I think it highlights big changes that are happening in the web design world. </p>



<p>But despite me never having an issue with it, it’s still interesting to read Brian Rinaldi’s notes about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/5-myths-about-jamstack/">5 of the most common Jamstack myths</a> he sees. The third myth is particularly interesting to me, the one that suggests that editing content is difficult. I definitely think that we’re some way away from having an ideal solution here but there are a ton of lovely CMS’s that can easily be used in your Jamstack projects. Just the other week I setup Netlify CMS and although the installation is definitely not one-click and you’re off, I still think it’s remarkably easier than it was to write content now. </p>

<p><strong>[Chris]:</strong> We all certainly like to argue about tabs vs spaces a lot. But have you considered <em>Fibonacci indentation</em>?!</p>

<p>Just a silly joke right. <em>Or is it?</em> I’m not sure if I would like it or hate it in day to day use, but I think it’s interesting to think about. Nested things that aren’t very deep aren’t very hard to reason about. Maybe those things don’t need that much indentation. But the deeper nesting gets, the harder it is to see and understand what is going on. Maybe more dramatic indentation is actually useful in that way. </p>

<p>In this post, Timothy Vernon has a lot of smart things to say about <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/improve-site-performance-inlining-css/">taking your styles out of CSS file and moving them into the HTML</a> for performance reasons:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>CSS is treated as a render-blocking resource — that is, if you include any form <code>&#60;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"&#62;</code> of in the document’s <code>&#60;head&#62;</code>, the browser will trigger an additional request to the server to retrieve that stylesheet </p>

<h3>Looking at inline CSS and performance</h3>



<p>In this post, Timothy Vernon has a lot of smart things to say about <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/improve-site-performance-inlining-css/">taking your styles out of CSS file and moving them into the HTML</a> for performance reasons:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>CSS is treated as a render-blocking resource — that is, if you include any form <code>&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> of in the document’s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, the browser will trigger an additional request to the server to retrieve that stylesheet before even beginning to render your page for the user.</p><p>While our internet providers, infrastructure, and servers are all getting faster every year, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Every network request to the server has a time cost, and the requests required to complete before the browser begins rendering the page are the most expensive.</p></blockquote>



<p>There are some trade-offs with this, as Timothy mentions. For example: now those styles are in your HTML, the download is certainly larger than before. It follows then makes to <em>only</em> serve the CSS that’s being used on that page and that’s commonly referred to as Critical CSS. Timothy mentions a few tools to help with that, such as Addy Osmani’s <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/critical">Critical</a> project.</p>

<h3>Looking at performance through JavaScript bundling</h3>



<p>Here’s a fantastic post where Ivan Akulov digs into the popular writing app Notion (we’re <a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/189-notion-for-personal-public-use/">big fans</a>) and looks at <a href="https://3perf.com/blog/notion/">why it’s particularly slow</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It turns out, almost every app has low-hanging fruits that could be implemented just by tuning the bundler configuration and doing a few precise code changes. </p></blockquote>



<p>Ivan gives us some pointers for how we can make our own websites and apps faster with techniques such as deferring JavaScript execution, code splitting, and removing polyfills.</p>

<h3>Global and Component Style Settings with CSS Variables</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/style-settings-with-css-variables/">Sara Soueidan writes</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I want to share my favorite two ways to use CSS Variables to organize and maintain styles in my projects today.</p></blockquote>



<p>Heck yeah! Sara then walks us through how she built a whole library of accessible components called Skeleton:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?fit=1024%2C623&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312498" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?w=3104&amp;ssl=1 3104w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?resize=1024%2C623&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?resize=1536%2C934&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?resize=2048%2C1246&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?resize=1000%2C608&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/skeleton.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Sara found that a lot of the styling properties between these components can be best maintained — and forked, then edited — with the help of CSS variables. This also allows her to quickly theme these components, too.</p>

<h3>A/B Testing Instant.Page With Netlify and Speedcurve</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ab-testing-dashboard-1.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312499" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ab-testing-dashboard-1.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ab-testing-dashboard-1.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ab-testing-dashboard-1.png?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://instant.page/">instant.page</a> is a script that you add to your site so that when a user hovers over a link that page is preloaded, making the whole experience once they click it just a tiny bit faster. Tim Kadlec wanted to investigate the effects of this on his personal site though and so he <a href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-05-21-ab-testing-instant-page-with-netlify-and-speedcurve/">set up an A/B test</a> with the help of Netlify:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Netlify supports branch-bases split testing, so first up was implementing instant.page on a separate branch. I downloaded the latest version so that I could self-host (there’s no reason to incur the separate connection cost) and dropped it into my page on a separate branch (very creatively called “instant-page”) and pushed to GitHub.</p></blockquote>



<p>Also: the fact that it’s so easy to setup an A/B test with Netlify is thoroughly bonkers to me. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to Tim’s blog… he’s got a follow up coming that looks at some reasons he was seeing what he was seeing, including some subtle bugs in how Netlify is doing things that might just get fixed up.</p>

<h3>The Best Design System Tool is Slack</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colors.jpg?fit=1024%2C794&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312500" width="560" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colors.jpg?w=1396&amp;ssl=1 1396w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colors.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colors.jpg?resize=1024%2C794&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colors.jpg?resize=768%2C596&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Colors.jpg?resize=1000%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>I know this is a catchy title and whatnot — I’m not trying to stir up drama — but it’s only because I’ve found that it’s best to meet folks where they are when working with design systems. Building lots of tools and writing lots of docs for components… All of this is useful, but <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-best-design-system-tool-is-slack/">99% of the conversations about design systems happen in Slack anyway</a>, so I wondered whether we could start to make <em>those</em> conversations easier to consolidate that information?</p>



<p>And what happens if we add some of that documentation to Slack itself? I looked into our Slackbot settings and added colors from our design system so that, whenever someone types in <code>color me</code>, all of the colors are shown in that Slack Channel, like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?fit=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312501" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?w=1604&amp;ssl=1 1604w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=1536%2C1097&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>It’s pretty handy! And only takes a couple of minutes to set up, too. No one needs to head to Figma or a style guide — they can quickly type their request, then get back to work.</p>

<h3>Updates to form styles have landed in Chrome 83</h3>



<p>Here’s some nifty updates to how forms look, but check out the <code>&lt;input type="time"&gt;</code> element Chrome 83 introduces. I struggled with that input on a recent project because I noticed Chrome didn’t support it at all. Now it does, though, so <em>hurrah</em>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-02-at-1.40.01-PM-1.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312502" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-02-at-1.40.01-PM-1.png?w=664&amp;ssl=1 664w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-02-at-1.40.01-PM-1.png?resize=278%2C300&amp;ssl=1 278w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>

<h3>Overlapping header with CSS Grid</h3>



<p>Here’s a smart post from Jonathan Snook about making the <a href="https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/overlapping-header-with-css-grid">header in this design overlap the content with CSS grid</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grid-b.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312503" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grid-b.png?w=871&amp;ssl=1 871w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grid-b.png?resize=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/grid-b.png?resize=768%2C756&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>It’s a pretty neat trick and shows that now we don’t have to do a lot of the weird layout magic hackery that we used to not so long ago.</p>

<h3>Here’s a post all about replicating Sass color functions in CSS</h3>



<p>Jim Nielsen wanted to remove Sass dependency on a recent project and started experimenting with HSL to <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/sass-color-functions-in-css/">replace certain Sass functions</a>, like <code>saturate</code>, <code>desaturate</code>, and <code>darken</code>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’ve felt quite happy as of late with no Sass in any of my personal projects. That said, I have always missed the color functions in Sass. I always loved those. Heck, I built a tool called SassMe which helps you visualize the output of Sass color functions in real time. All of this got me thinking: could you actually do an equivalent of something like Sass’ saturate() in CSS in 2020? Short answer: you can!</p></blockquote>



<p>All of this riffs off of Lea Verou’s article called <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/a-users-guide-to-css-variables/">“A user’s guide to CSS variables”</a> which is worth every moment of your time. There’s just so much good stuff in there. But <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/a-users-guide-to-css-variables/#creating-color-palettes">the section about color</a> is especially interesting.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>And, last but not least, here’s how to make a close button</h3>



<p>These types of buttons can be found everywhere on the web: in modals and overlays, on ads and video pop-ups. But! Making them with accessibility in mind should always be important. Manuel Matuzović breaks down <a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/20-close-buttons/">all the patterns we need to avoid</a> and the best practices we need to consider whilst making them.</p>

<h3>Have you seen <a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic/status/1084880013436936192">Lynn Fisher’s amazing thread</a> of CSS memes?</h3>



<p>I love how positivity focused there are. Rather than pooping on CSS being confusing or hard, they are focused on CSS killin’ it.</p>



<p>GIFs are the only thing that will work in email, and they are huge, so I’ll just do one:</p>

<p>The other day a rather lovely magazine arrived in the mail called <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/">Increment</a>, published by the folks at Stripe, and I can’t wait to get my teeth sunk into it. Also, Chris happened to write a post in this issue all about <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/">the growing responsibilities of front-end developers</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Being a frontend developer requires an ever-larger grab bag of skills. It’s the natural outcome of the web getting bigger. As more people use the web, as the internet economy expands, and as browsers gain more capabilities and grow more complex, our expectations of what’s possible on the web grow with them.</p></blockquote>



<p>I think Chris asks a ton of interesting questions in this post and expands upon his thoughts in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">The Great Divide</a>. This time around I feel a hint of optimism here: <em>yes, things are getting more complex</em>, Chris suggests, <em>but also there’s so many exciting things that us front-end developers can now improve and fix and, best of all, build</em>.</p>



<p>The nifty thing about this magazine is that all of the issues are also available for the web too, so you can read all about Lea Verou’s <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/a-users-guide-to-css-variables/">guide to CSS variables</a> or Safia Abdalla’s thoughts on <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/on-composable-modular-frontends/">composable, modular frontends</a>, or Ramsey Nasser’s <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/a-frontend-stack-for-video-games/">frontend stack for video games</a>.</p>

<h3>Google has new performance metrics called…</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cwv-extension-screenshot.png?fit=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312091" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cwv-extension-screenshot.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cwv-extension-screenshot.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cwv-extension-screenshot.png?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cwv-extension-screenshot.png?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cwv-extension-screenshot.png?resize=1000%2C625&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>…<a href="https://css-tricks.com/core-web-vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a>! And they seem like an interesting collection of data points that help us best understand <em>what</em> the performance problem with our websites might be and <em>how</em> we might go about fixing the issue. Here’s what those metrics are though (and I can imagine us seeing numbers with these abbreviations <em>a lot</em> from here on out):</p>



<ol><li><strong>LCP</strong>: Largest Contentful Paint</li><li><strong>FID</strong>: First Input Delay</li><li><strong>CLS</strong>: Cumulative Layout Shift</li></ol>



<p>To see how your site stacks up against these metrics today you can use <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals-extension/">the Chrome extension</a> that happens to look something like the screenshot above. From <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html">the blog post</a> introducing these new fangled things though, it sounds like these metrics will start to be added to PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse as well as Chrome DevTools pretty soon. Hopefully this gives us a better way to communicate as developers about this stuff, too.</p>

<h3>A first look at <code>aspect-ratio</code></h3>



<p>That’s the name of a new CSS property and Chris hops into the new hot thing by walking us through how <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-first-look-at-aspect-ratio/"><code>aspect-ratio</code></a> works with a bunch of scenarios. First up, throw it on an element like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
}</code></pre>



<p>Considering an element like this will have a width of auto by default, the height here will be calculated from that. But! This is what makes this property interesting, as Chris makes note:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If the element has either a height or width, the other is calculated from the aspect ratio.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s pretty remarkable how quickly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL58Wk5g77lF8jzqp_1cViDf-WilJsAvqT">the videos</a> for this year’s conference were published. The talks cover a wide spectrum of topics, each of them interesting in their own right, and discuss a ton of things that have been made possible with the Jamstack, such as the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">COVID Tracking Project</a>.</p>



<p>The talks also come with the news from Netlify of their latest feature, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/27/netlify-build-plugins-are-here/">Build Plugins</a>. This allows us developers to do a bunch of nifty things when a Netlify build gets triggered. For instance, you could check for broken links, or misspelled words, or inline your critical CSS.</p>



<p>I think what’s exciting about this announcement for me is that I can see tools such as Grunt and Gulp and even Webpack to some degree becoming less necessary over time with an extended list of plugins. And this decreases the complexity of build tools because yikes I cannot imagine how much time I’ve spent wondering why this one weird Gulp thing keeps happening.</p>



<p>I can’t wait to see where this stuff goes.</p>

<p>Ethan Marcotte has made <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/responsive-design-at-10/">a few notes about the anniversary</a> of coining the term which makes for a fascinating read:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Around that time, my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/drinkerthinker">Elizabeth</a> visited <a href="https://www.thehighline.org/">the High Line in New York City</a> shortly after it opened. When she got back, she told me about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6IrqxRrLbU">these wheeled lounge chairs</a> she saw in one section, and how people would move them apart for a bit of solitude, or push a few chairs together to sit closer to friends. We got to excitedly chatting about them. I thought there was something really compelling about that image: a space that could be controlled, reshaped, and <em>redesigned</em> by the people who moved through it.</p><p>I remember spending that evening reading more about those chairs and, from there, about more dynamic forms of architecture. I read about concepts for walls built with tensile materials and embedded sensors, and how those walls could bend and flex as people drew near to them. I read about glass walls that could become opaque at the flip of a switch, or when movement was detected. I even bought a rather wonderful book on the subject, <a href="https://www.papress.com/html/product.details.dna?isbn=9781568988368">Interactive Architecture</a>, which described these new spaces as “a conversation” between physical objects or spaces, and the people who interacted with them.</p><p>After a few days of research, I found some articles that alternated between two different terms for the same concept. They’d call it interactive architecture, sure, but then they’d refer to it with a different name: <em>responsive</em> architecture.</p></blockquote>



<p>Just a few days later Ethan followed up with another piece but this time about the challenges that a lot of folks are currently experiencing with responsive design, especially when it comes to <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/responsive-design-seams-edges/">naming breakpoints</a> such as “mobile,” “tablet” or “desktop”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…focusing on two or three key layouts often means that the “in-between” states don’t get as much attention from digital teams. (Filament Group’s Todd Parker calls these the “awkward teenage haircuts” of a responsive layout, and I love that term.) And as devices and viewports continue to evolve, our users will likely start seeing those previously-ignored breakpoints.</p></blockquote>



<p>This reminds me of something I jotted down not so long ago when it comes to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/thinking-in-behaviors-not-screen-sizes/">Thinking in Behaviors, Not Screen Sizes</a> which might be worth a read as well.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Thoughts on browser engine diversity</h3>



<p>There’s been <em>a lot</em> of talk about browser engine diversity recently—especially since Microsoft discontinued Internet Explorer—and most of that talk certainly hasn’t been positive. Many folks have decried the lack of diversity and the sad state of affairs that one bad actor might have an enormous influence of the shape of the web. And this, in turn, makes everything worse for us as users of the web first and foremost.</p>



<p>But Brian Kardell has a bunch of interesting thoughts here which I hadn’t considered but now seem awfully obvious in hindsight—<a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/EcosystemHealth.html">most browsers evolved and didn’t start from scratch</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Web engines today are so astonishingly complex (measured in tens of millions of lines of code) that we only get new ones through evolution. For the most part, this has been true for a long time. Even Netscape was a “take 2” from many of the same minds from Mosaic. Mozilla was created from a rework of Netscape. Even IE was born by licensing the Mosaic code. WebKit was born by forking KHTML. In other words: The critical investment required to create a full-blown compliant browser from nothing would be mind-boggling if everything were stopped today – and it never stops.</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element that plays those guitar chords over and over. If you’re also a guitar player, the idea with the chart is that those notes are within the scale that traditionally works best with those chords, so you can practice noodling around and playing lead. I spent a bit of an afternoon playing banjo along with it! </p>



<p>The (very anonymous) creator emailed me about it and mentioned that while they are into a variety of newer/fancier tech, this thing is “just” a WordPress website, as WordPress made it delightfully simple to toss up a site like this. Could you build this with just about anything? Sure. But, like them, I probably would have leaned on WordPress too. WordPress would make publishing new entries really easy (log in, upload audio, upload graphic, publish). It gives you an easy way to publish pages that aren’t part of the flow (about, contact).

<h3>Framer Web has moved to the browser</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.framer.com/">It looks pretty great.</a> I’ve yet to design anything substantial with it yet but I love the UI—the use of colors and the smart way they display critical information is quite lovely. What differentiates it from other design tools? Well, it looks like that Framer specializes in animations and prototyping; two pretty let-down features in design tools to date. But no more! Framer is looking to really change things here, and I think it shows.</p>



<p>They also have a ton of <a href="https://www.framer.com/examples/">examples built in Framer</a> to get started with:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?fit=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-311593" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?w=3268&amp;ssl=1 3268w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?resize=1536%2C933&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?resize=2048%2C1245&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?resize=1000%2C608&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-23-at-6.28.12-PM-1.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>These are definitely worth checking out because I think from a distance it’s easy to say that all design tools do a lot of similar things but… well… I think this could be different. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/176-working-with-framer-motion/">Check out this video we did on Framer Motion</a> a bit ago, which is already a standout in the world of React animation. </p>

<h3>Here’s how to make Google Fonts load 20% faster</h3>



<p>Earlier this week Harry Roberts wrote a great piece where he investigates how fonts served from Google Fonts load and how he can help us make them <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">load even faster</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s widely accepted that self-hosted fonts are the fastest option: same origin means reduced network negotiation, predictable URLs mean we can <code>preload</code>, self-hosted means we can set our own <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/"><code>cache-control</code> directives</a>, and full ownership mitigates <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/">the risks that come with leaving static assets on third-party origins</a>.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>That said, the convenience of a service like Google Fonts cannot be overstated. Their ability to serve the tiniest possible font files tailored to specific user agents and platforms is amazing, and with such a huge, freely-available library served from Google-grade CDNs… I definitely see why people continue to turn to it.</p></blockquote>



<p>The trick here is really 3 things: using <code>preconnect</code> on the Google Fonts URL:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;link rel="preconnect"
      href="https://fonts.gstatic.com"
      crossorigin /&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Then <code>preload</code>ing the fonts and setting it to use <code>display: swap</code>:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;link rel="preload"
      as="style"
      href="$CSS&amp;display=swap" /&gt;</code></pre>



<p>(<code>$CSS</code> is the URL that Google gives you after you’ve selected which font you want). </p>



<p>And finally we need to use a rather clever trick with the stylesheet:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
      href="$CSS&amp;display=swap"
      media="print" onload="this.media='all'" /&gt;</code></pre>



<p>This is using Filament Group’s smarty pants trick of using that Scott Jehl wrote about in <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/">The Simplest Way to to Load CSS Asynchronously</a>. It’s a nifty trick that’s worth keeping in the ol’ toolbox, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>This reminds me: Scott’s new video course, <a href="https://scottjehl.com/lfwp/">Lightning Fast Web Performance</a>, dropped the other day. In it, he walks us through how to make a website load as quickly as the speed of light. Scott looks at the dev tools, the tricks, and the theory behind why websites need to be fast.</p>

<h3>Flexible grids are the coolest!</h3>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/flexible-grids/">In this post</a> (part of our in-progress book of the best CSS tricks), Chris takes a gander at CSS Grid and how to make a column layout that doesn’t declare the number of columns or rows, but automatically instead. Chris calls this <em>“the most famous and useful code in all of CSS Grid”</em>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}</code></pre>



<p>What we’re doing with that last line of code is saying “I want a grid with infinite columns, but each column must be at least 200px and always the same width as each other.” That’s certainly a mouthful but it’s extremely powerful. I tend to forget this each time I need it so I’m jotting it down again for the future, too.</p>



<p>Speaking of CSS Grid… even when you’re just trying to have a bunch of boxes fall into a horizontal row, which is often flexbox territory, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/flexbox-like-just-put-elements-in-a-row-with-css-grid/">you can use grid for that also</a>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min-content, 1fr));
}</code></pre>



<p>Still flexible! And supports <code>gap</code>, which flexbox is only just starting to.</p>

<h3>Enhance your Page Transitions </h3>



<p>Native-like transitions have always been a thing that web developers have looked at and been enraged with pure jealousy because getting those types of animations to work for everyone can be a bit of a giant un-ending pain. But! Sam Smith has taken a look at <a href="https://smth.uk/enhance-your-web-page-transitions/">how to progressively enhance them</a> so they do just that. He writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Page transitions on the Web are typically very abrupt – you click a link, then the browser replaces the current page with the new one, as quickly as it can. This is a good starting point, and perhaps sometimes what we want, but a more gradual transition can be easier for people to follow. Visual transitions are what we are used to in the “real world”; sudden changes don’t tend to happen, aside from perhaps a power outage (which is never welcome). Animating transitions can offer continuity and make it easier to retain context.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sam does all this with the help of <a href="https://barba.js.org/">barba.js</a>, a handy dandy animation library.</p>

<h3>How to build a Chrome extension</h3>



<p>Sarah Drasner digs into how she built five Chrome extensions lately and wanted to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension/">document the experience</a> for the future:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I made a Chrome extension this weekend because I found I was doing the same task over and over and wanted to automate it. Plus, I’m a nerd during a pandemic, so I spend my weird pent-up energy building things. I’ve made five Chrome extensions with that energy, yet I still find it hard to locate the docs to make them. Some things are outdated or deprecated. Some things are simply buried. I’m writing this as a bit of tutorial (1) in case it’s helpful to others and certainly (2) for myself the next time I want to build a Chrome extension.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sarah’s adventures on this front remind me of Lindsay Grizzard’s <a href="https://css-tricks.com/control-the-internet-with-chrome-extensions/">excellent post on the subject</a>, too. In that post though she walks through a specific example: her Chrome extension that loads the definition of a word every time you open up a new tab. Just like this:</p>

<p><strong>[Chris]:</strong> I’d like to shout-out to Jake Archibald’s use of SVG in his blog posts over the years. Jake uses SVG for things SVG is really <em>really</em> great at, playing to its strength and avoiding its weaknesses. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Figures / llustrations…</li><li>… that have interesting design and layout</li><li>… that use <em>real text</em>, not image-ized text</li><li>… that scale with their aspect ratio without any trickery</li><li>… that are animated</li></ul>



<p>I have to <s>ironically</s> sadly embed static graphics here to show you as this is going out over email, but definitely check out the originals on Jake’s site.</p>

<h3>Lynn Fisher’s Single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> Project is Amazing</h3>



<p>Lynn Fisher has been up to some serious tricks making these rather beautiful <a href="https://a.singlediv.com/">single div designs</a> with nothing but the power of CSS. They’re extremely cute and impressive to boot:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-8.22.39-PM.png?fit=1024%2C542&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-311249" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-8.22.39-PM.png?w=1244&amp;ssl=1 1244w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-8.22.39-PM.png?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-8.22.39-PM.png?resize=1024%2C542&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-8.22.39-PM.png?resize=768%2C406&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-8.22.39-PM.png?resize=1000%2C529&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>To get started making things like this, it might be good to check out our guide to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/">making shapes with CSS</a>. I use that piece all the time when I’m working on some neat-o CSS work.</p>

<h3>What I wish I knew about React</h3>



<p>A little while back, Ire Aderinokun wrote about what she wishes she <a href="https://bitsofco.de/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-react/">knew about React</a> before she started:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The way I like to think of it in comparison to Angular is this: Angular is a framework for architecting and building applications. It, for the most part, doesn’t change the way you write your HTML or CSS, but it heavily controls the way you write Javascript.</p><p>React, on the other hand, is a library for building user interfaces. It, for the most part, doesn’t change the way you write Javascript that isn’t directly related to your UI, but it heavily controls the way you write HTML and CSS (or the equivalent of it).</p></blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Have you heard of the <code>clamp()</code> CSS function?</h3>



<p>Kevin Powell made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo&amp;feature=emb_title">a great video about this</a> very subject that goes into a bunch of depth and gives a few great examples for how to use it.</p>



<p><code>clamp()</code>effectively allows us to set a max/min value of an element. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/16887">Jeremy Keith also wrote about it</a> a short bit ago and shared how he used it to make the text responsive in a project. He set a max and min <code>font-size</code> just like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.element {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 0.666vw, 1.5rem);
}</code></pre>



<p>There are a few edge cases veto consider here, so it’s definitely worth reading the post above to check those first.</p>



<p>On a separate note, one point that Jeremy makes in that article above that caught my eye is where he talks about how many features in Sass have been merged into regular CSS and likewise for jQuery and JavaScript:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the goal of any good library should be to get so successful as to make itself redundant. That is, the ideas and functionality provided by the tool are so useful and widely adopted that the native technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—take their cue from those tools.</p></blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Here’s the low-down on CSS and <code>line-height</code></h3>



<p>The <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/line-height/">line-height</a></code> CSS property can be a fickle and annoying thing. I’ve come tons of cases where it was clear that <code>line-height</code> was the cause of some tiny visual problem and that a lot of folks didn’t really understand how it worked.</p>



<p>Caleb Williams has written all about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-tame-line-height-in-css/">how to tame line-height</a>, walking us through all the typographic terms in the process.</p>

<h3>Proper VoiceOver support coming soon to Firefox on MacOS</h3>



<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/accessibility/proper-voiceover-support-coming-soon-to-firefox-on-macos/">This is exciting news!</a> By the end of the year, VoiceOver is expected to be supported in Firefox as long as a host of other improvements.</p>



<p>Yay for accessibility!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Notion-powered websites</h3>



<p>Here’s a nifty idea: make a doc in Notion public with the flip of a switch and, with something like <a href="https://super.so/">Super</a> in tow, you can easily make a website with a custom domain and fonts. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/notion-powered-websites/">Chris writes about all this</a> and he’s written about how he uses Notion <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-ive-been-using-notion-personally-and-professionally/">personally and professionally</a> in the past.</p>



<p>At my new gig with Sentry, <em>everything</em> is in a Notion doc and it’s sort of like the company database. Need to know something? Head on over to Notion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?fit=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-311251" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?w=3048&amp;ssl=1 3048w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?resize=1536%2C989&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?resize=2048%2C1318&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-5.45.44-PM.png?resize=1000%2C644&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>I can see how Notion might support this sort of feature eventually by making it even easier to create tiny websites and apps from within Notion itself, and the thought of that is exciting.</p>

<h3>Putting the scroll percentage in the title bar</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3b09df5d8ad1864a1277f312b61db3bc0ad66230-624x294-1.gif?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-311252" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Notice how in the gif above the title changes as the users scrolls? That’s <a href="https://www.knutmelvaer.no/blog/2020/05/how-i-put-the-scroll-percentage-in-the-title-bar/">a neat trick by Knut Melvær</a> where he writes about his solution with React.</p>



<p>Chris then riffed on this and made <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-i-put-the-scroll-percentage-in-the-browser-title-bar/">a plain ol’ JavaScript solution</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2019/11/12/recurring-payments/?aff=8638">WordPress.com now supports payments… even recurring!</a></h2>



<p>Let’s say you need to build a site that can take money from customers, but on a recurring basis. <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2019/11/12/recurring-payments/?aff=8638">WordPress.com can do that now</a>, and it’s a fantastic choice because it’s all of the power and control and none of the debt.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>[Chris]:</strong> I was interviewed in Justin Avery’s <a href="https://responsivedesign.is/">RWD Weekly</a> the other week. The term “Responsive Web Design” is just a week away from being <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">10 years old</a>. It’s certainly the biggest change in web design since then. It’s gone from something that needed a lot of discussion to a a basic requirement for about any project.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Is responsive something that you have to sell in any more or does everyone get it now?</strong></p><p>I can say that it seems like responsive design is just an assumption. I think that responsive design was an assumption in 2015. Even then, if you delivered a website to a client that was just a zoomed out “desktop” website they would assume it’s broken and that you didn’t really do your job. Today, even more so. It’s just not done.</p></blockquote>

<h3>There’s exciting things on the horizon for CSS layout</h3>



<p><a href="https://css-irl.info/exciting-things-on-the-horizon-for-css-layout/">Michelle Barker has the scoop</a> on all the upcoming things to get excited about, such as:</p>



<ul><li>Support is coming soon for the <code>gap</code> CSS property when used with Flexbox in Chrome (yay!).</li><li>Masonry-style layouts will soon be possible Firefox.</li><li>Chrome previewing a new Grid inspector, which looks like this:</li></ul>

<h3>Early web aesthetics ❤️</h3>



<p>I love this site called <a href="https://vistaserv.net/">Vistaserv.net</a> that mimics the style of 90s websites, with non-aliased fonts and tiny gifs all over the place. <a href="https://vistaserv.net/blog/90s-fonts-modern-browsers">They even wrote up</a> how they made a modern browser look and feel like an old one. Just like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?fit=1024%2C925&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-310860" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?w=2054&amp;ssl=1 2054w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?resize=1024%2C925&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?resize=768%2C694&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?resize=1536%2C1388&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?resize=2048%2C1851&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-10.40.22-PM.png?resize=1000%2C904&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Throughout the post, they talk about the specific typographic style of the old web, but it’s still a fun read even if you aren’t a big font nerd like me.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Speaking of fonts…</h3>



<p>The TypeMedia class of 2019 made <a href="https://2019.typemedia.org/">an excellent website</a> that showcases the work of the twelve students who spent that year learning about type design. Really though, the website is just astonishingly lovely and has a bunch of details that us web designers should take a close look at (like the really cool navigation that doesn’t feel obnoxious):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-7.55.04-PM.png?fit=1024%2C838&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-310861" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-7.55.04-PM.png?w=1468&amp;ssl=1 1468w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-7.55.04-PM.png?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-7.55.04-PM.png?resize=1024%2C838&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-7.55.04-PM.png?resize=768%2C628&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-10-at-7.55.04-PM.png?resize=1000%2C818&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Even if fonts and type design isn’t your jam, I think there’s <em>so</em> much we can learn from type designers — the way they do graphic design, their use of color and shape, and the charming, easy-going copywriting style that’s found every where from their type specimens to the design notes about their work.</p>

<h3>Have you heard of the CSS <code>contain</code> property?</h3>



<p>MDN has this to say about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain">the <code>contain</code> property</a>: “This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance benefits.” That sounds…pretty neat! And thankfully, Travis Almand has written <a href="https://css-tricks.com/lets-take-a-deep-dive-into-the-css-contain-property/">a guide to walk us through it.</a></p>



<p>The general idea is that we can tell browsers how to more efficiently render things. As Travis mentions, though, it’s difficult to <em>see</em> the performance benefits. Even so, he does a pretty darn good job of doing it!</p>

<h3>Chris has been making a whole bunch of nifty videos lately</h3>



<p>I love these. So far Chris has made videos about how to make <a href="https://youtu.be/8bhKjoowr4c">a grid of squares</a> with CSS Grid, explored how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To5cBX8P_QY">HTML lists</a> work, and tinkered around with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEDO68FEJM">video on mobile devices</a>, just to name a few.</p>

<h3>We just published our complete guide to CSS Functions!</h3>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-to-css-functions/">Here it is!</a> This post goes into <em>a lot</em> of depth about how they’re used and what you can do with them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Like any other programming language, CSS has functions. They can be inserted where you’d place a value, or in some cases, accompanying another value declaration. Some CSS functions even let you nest other functions within them!</p></blockquote>



<p>The funny thing is that I didn’t really think about something like <code>background-image: url('image.png');</code> as a function, but it totally is. You pass it an argument and it does a thing based on that data. I think the most common CSS function I use is <code>calc</code> — it’s just so dang handy that I can’t think of making a website without it. Good thing we have <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/">a complete guide</a> to that, too. </p>

<h3>Styling in the Shadow DOM with CSS Shadow Parts </h3>



<p>Ollie Williams looks at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/styling-in-the-shadow-dom-with-css-shadow-parts/">Shadow Parts</a> with the <code>::part()</code> selector now being available in most popular browsers. It effectively allows us to make certain <em>parts</em> of a component to be styled with CSS. So, we sort of get all the benefits of using the Shadow DOM and allow those components to be extended and customized with styles from the outside. Here’s one advantage that Ollie describes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Shadow DOM allows us to feel fully confident that a component will render as expected, regardless of what codebase it ends up in. Equally, none of the code meant only for a component can inadvertently affect anything else — all without resorting to onerous class naming conventions. Shadow DOM offers a level of encapsulation that can’t be achieved any other way.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>[Chris]:</strong> I think the most linked-to, quoted-from, celebrated article in all of web design and development is John Allsopp’s <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">A Dao of Web Design</a>. It established the attitude, correctly so, that the web is just <em>a different thing</em> that anything before it, with all its unknowns and flexible nature. </p>



<p>Well, that article is 20 years old now, and John marked the occasion in the best possible way: <a href="https://www.webdirections.org/blog/it-was-20-years-ago-today/">a blog post</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the years since it was published it’s continued to be referenced and to resonate, at least with some, something for which I am also immensely grateful, not least at the start of Ethan Marcotte’s ground breaking essay in the same publication, <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> which coined the term we all know so well, and outlined the basic framework for the foundations of how so many design and build for the web today–Ethan’s piece itself will be 10 years old next month.</p></blockquote>



<p>It feels like a rare moon-alignment moment that A Dao of Web Design turns 20 and Responsive Web Design turns 10 at so near the same time. </p>



<p>What is happening right now that we’ll look back on with such reverence in 10 more years? I’m not sure we’d be able to guess right now. Is it Jamstack? Is it progressive web apps? Is it component-driven development? Design systems? </p>

<h3>Setting text inside a circle with CSS</h3>



<p>I totally forgot that this is possible with the <code>shape-outside</code> CSS property. As <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-css-to-set-text-inside-a-circle/">Kerry Smyth shows in this demo</a>, we can use that property <em>twice</em> to force text to float around two different paths, giving us shape on both sides (in this case, a circle). It’s neat that browser tools have come so far as to give us this really nice visual representation as we build it, too:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/text-circle-03.png?fit=1024%2C645&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-308174" width="560" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/text-circle-03.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/text-circle-03.png?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/text-circle-03.png?resize=1024%2C645&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/text-circle-03.png?resize=768%2C484&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/text-circle-03.png?resize=1000%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>As Kerry mentions in this post, I’m excited for <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shapes-2/#propdef-shape-inside"><code>shape-inside</code></a> which will let us create a shape to wrap the content within an element more naturally, too.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>The Hero Generator</h3>



<p>To get things started, Sarah Edo made a wonderful <a href="https://hero-generator.netlify.app/">Hero Generator</a> that lets you modify a ton of options like the gradient, the image, and the positioning of elements like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/generator.gif?fit=1024%2C649&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-308177" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Once you’ve messed about with the options you can generate all the code at the flick of a switch. Super neat.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Oh, that reminds me: the CSS Grid Generator is super neat, too.</h3>



<p>Not so long ago Sarah made another handy generator but this time all about <a href="https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/">CSS Grid</a>: this one lets you draw columns and rows on a grid and then export the styles and markup.</p>

<p>In the description for that demo Sarah makes note of the <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/">CSS Grid Garden</a> which is a tool I saw a long time ago but forgot to return to. It’s pretty dang fantastic as it walks you through how to build very simple grid layouts and first — until by the end you’re wielding space and time like a wizard.</p>

<h2>generic-components is wondrous!</h2>



<p>Not so long ago I remember ranting to a pal that the most annoying thing about third-party component libraries is the fact that they come bundled with styles. Because every time I want to just make sure I have a baseline understanding of the accessibility issues of, say, a tab component or an accordion.</p>



<p>Having all the styles bundled without a component is frustrating to me because I never want to keep something the same visually. And this will then involve me going down a rabbit hole of either replicating the accessibility features that component has or hacking the styles on top of it and just calling it a day.</p>



<p>Well! My prayers have been answered with the <a href="https://modest-bhaskara-e8742f.netlify.app/"><code>generic-components</code></a> project. It’s a collection of web components with accessibility in mind and they’re super easy to style.</p>

<h3>Here’s a look at styling and animating the progress element</h3>



<p>See how in the progress of the video below there’s a fancy gradient from orange to pink? That’s what Geoff builds in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/some-innocent-fun-with-html-video-and-progress/">this fun post about HTML video</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-03-at-4.15.46-PM.png?fit=1024%2C579&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-308179" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-03-at-4.15.46-PM.png?w=1482&amp;ssl=1 1482w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-03-at-4.15.46-PM.png?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-03-at-4.15.46-PM.png?resize=1024%2C579&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-03-at-4.15.46-PM.png?resize=768%2C434&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-03-at-4.15.46-PM.png?resize=1000%2C565&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Geoff then walks us through how to grab the current time of the video and display it as a percentage in the progress HTML element. It’s nifty stuff.</p>

<h3>Have you heard about Alpine.js?</h3>



<p>If not, no fear! Hugo Di Francesco has written up his thoughts about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/alpine-js-the-javascript-framework-thats-used-like-jquery-written-like-vue-and-inspired-by-tailwindcss/">this interesting new framework</a> that’s “used like jQuery, written like Vue, and inspired by Tailwind CSS”. Here’s the super brief intro from Hugo:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Alpine.js is not designed to build SPAs, but rather enhance your templates with a little bit of JavaScript.</p></blockquote>



<p>After thinking about it for all of two seconds, I love that it mirrors a lot of the Vue syntax and the fact that it is so much smaller than jQuery (only 23% the size!) makes it a pretty compelling tool to pick up the next time I need something like this.</p>

<h3>Formik can help handle forms for us in React</h3>



<p>In <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-formik-to-handle-forms-in-react/">the docs for Formik</a> it states that:</p>



<p>Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:</p>



<ul><li>Getting values in and out of form state</li><li>Validation and error messages</li><li>Handling form submission</li></ul>



<p>But how should we go about getting started? Well, Adebiyi Adedotun has the scoop on this and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-formik-to-handle-forms-in-react/">why Formik is so gosh darn helpful</a>. This is because when using React forms can get complicated real quick. There’s so much state to manage—errors, data, etc.—that it gets overwhelming to deal with.</p>

<h2>Advice for writing a technical resume</h2>



<p>Sarah has a bunch of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/advice-for-writing-a-technical-resume/">thoughts about resumes</a>, as she’s been on both sides of the table. If you’re looking for a new gig it might be a good idea to take a quick look at this list to make sure you’re not making some common mistakes.</p>



<p>I’d also quickly underline what Sarah mentions at the end of this post: <em>everyone</em> gets turned down for a job, no matter how smart and brilliant they are. It’s really hard though not to let the stress of finding a new gig get to you. And I would know! I just ended months and months of interviews and got turned down by an embarrassing number of folks to find myself with a new gig that I genuinely love.</p>



<p>You just have to keep trying and apply for every gig that comes your way, ignoring every devastating no that comes your way</p>

<h2><a href="https://wordpress.com/?aff=8638">WordPress.com has even more blocks and ways to build the perfect website</a></h2>



<p>Seems like the WordPress.com team is shipping tons of new features for the already fantastic Block Editor lately. Six new blocks that connect with Eventbrite, Pinterest, Mapbox, and more<a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/04/02/new-blocks-for-your-business/"> just came out this week</a>. Last week, they released a slick new way to <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/03/26/block-editor-upgrades/?aff=8638">build complete page layouts with block patterns</a>. There’s even an event all about blocks that’s <a href="https://wordpress.tv/event/wpblocktalk-april-2020/?aff=8638">posted on WordPress.tv</a>!</p>



<p>Point is, WordPress.com is constantly evolving and continues to be the gold standard for hosted sites. Give the new blocks a try by signing up. It’s free and takes just a few clicks to get going.</p>

<p>To cap things off this week, have you seen <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a>? I’ve seen it linked up six ways to Sunday so I bet you have, but just in case you haven’t it’s a real pleasure. to look through. It’s a CSS library emulating the look of Windows 98, which is an aesthetic I bet a lot of people have in their brain somewhere even if you weren’t an active user.</p>



<p>The bevel-and-emboss to “sink” <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>s and “rise” <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s is so classic. I’m sure that the modern aesthetic of barely indicating if something is a button at all kinda helps us feel nostalgic for this. <em>Now that’s a button!</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-6.06.35-AM.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-308182" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-6.06.35-AM.png?w=822&amp;ssl=1 822w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-6.06.35-AM.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-6.06.35-AM.png?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>What doesn’t feel right anymore is how <em>tight</em> everything is. That probably didn’t feel so tight when monitors were generally smaller and much less pixel dense.</p>



<p>The font used for more components is “ms_sans_serif.woff2”, which in following the links in the license from the repo, leads to <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1384746/ms-sans-serif">MS Sans Serif</a> which is Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 👍.</p>

<h3>What’s the cost of using a JavaScript framework?</h3>



<p>That’s the question that Tim Kadlec answers in <a href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/">this very in-depth post</a> where he grabs data from the HTTP Archive and compares different frameworks against one another, testing how much they all impact performance.</p>



<p>I don’t want to dig into the stats specifically because I don’t think that’s the most interesting part of this post. Instead, it’s this part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><span style="font-size: inherit;">In an ideal world, I believe a framework should go beyond developer experience value and provide concrete value for the people using our sites. Performance is just one part of that—accessibility and security both come to mind as well—but it’s an essential part.</span></p><p>So in an ideal world, a framework makes it easier to perform well by either providing a better starting point or providing constraints and characteristics that make it hard to build something that doesn’t perform well.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tim digs into the performance of these frameworks <em>after</em> the bytes have been sent down the wire because there’s a performance cost whenever all that JavaScript has to be run, too. And I think it’s worth mentioning that this post from Tim isn’t just dunking on frameworks — it’s pushing us all to try harder rather than simply accepting the status quo when making websites.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?fit=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307649" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?w=1640&amp;ssl=1 1640w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?resize=1536%2C772&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.36.59-PM.png?resize=1000%2C502&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Hopefully this is some pressure for the JavaScript frameworks to do better, as while it isn’t their fault exactly, it’s telling when even the top 10% best-performing are pointedly worse than not using a framework. It’s the same situation as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-is-not-a-react-problem/">accessibility and frameworks</a>. No need to point fingers, but the frameworks are in the best position to make a difference.</p>

<h3>Improving your VS Code Workflow</h3>



<p>There’s <a href="https://css-tricks.com/some-little-improvements-to-my-vs-code-workflow-workspaces-icons-tasks/">a handful of nifty improvements</a> here and my favorite one has to be how Chris saved his VS Code workspaces to his dock and then made custom icons for them so it looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-6.41.48-PM.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307642" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-6.41.48-PM.png?w=492&amp;ssl=1 492w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-6.41.48-PM.png?resize=300%2C116&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>Now, whenever he clicks one of these links it boots up VS Code with the right workspace <em>and</em> with the correct terminal commands running. Pretty neat!</p>

<p>So says our very own Geoff Graham where, in this post, he shows us <a href="https://geoffgraham.me/theres-an-input-attribute-for-a-one-time-code/">how to autocomplete input fields</a> with the two factor authentication codes that happen to look like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?fit=1024%2C690&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307643" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?w=1544&amp;ssl=1 1544w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?resize=1024%2C690&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?resize=768%2C517&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?resize=1536%2C1035&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-time-code-text.png?resize=1000%2C674&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>This is done by using the following markup:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;input type="number" autocomplete="one-time-code" /&gt;</code></pre>



<p>That’s pretty neat and is bound to save folks a whole bunch of time typing in these annoying but extremely useful codes.</p>



<p>Alex Holachek did <a href="https://css-tricks.com/better-form-inputs-for-better-mobile-user-experiences/">a deeper look into all this</a> recently. There is a lot of <code>autocomplete</code> values and it’s likely most of us aren’t taking advantage of all of them (not to mention <code>inputmode</code>). </p>

<h3>Here’s a tab I can’t close because it’s too pretty</h3>



<p>It’s the type specimen for Klim Type’s <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/heldane-text/">the Heldane Collection</a>. Just, wow! Klim’s designs are always charming and eye-popping and. just. look.</p>

<p>The neat thing about this type specimen is that it also acts as an essay about the design of the typeface itself. Gah. I love this thing so very much.</p>

<h3>CSS Separator Generator</h3>



<p>That’s a weird bunch of words to put together but it describes this website perfectly: you can use <a href="https://wweb.dev/resources/css-separator-generator">this CSS generator</a> to quickly generate backgrounds if you want to make the bit between sections of your website more interesting:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?fit=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307645" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?w=2950&amp;ssl=1 2950w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?resize=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?resize=768%2C481&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?resize=1536%2C961&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?resize=2048%2C1282&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-26-at-5.59.56-PM.png?resize=1000%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Should come in pretty handy soon for me.</p>



<p>If the <em>diagonal</em> separator is the one that catches your eye here, here’s <a href="https://css-tricks.com/create-diagonal-layouts-like-its-2020/">a much deeper look</a> into that one. </p>

<h3>SVG, Favicons, and all the fun things we can do with them</h3>



<p>SVG favicons have some degree of support across the board now, and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-favicons-and-all-the-fun-things-we-can-do-with-them/">Eric Bailey walks us through it all</a>. Chrome and Firefox will take a straight up <code>.svg</code> file instead of <code>.ico</code>, and Safari has that special “pinned” “mask” thing. </p>



<p>The cool things is that this unlocks some tricky like re-styling the SVG in dark mode or when high contrast is activated:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307657" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?resize=1024%2C427&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?resize=768%2C320&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?resize=1536%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?resize=1000%2C417&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ-1.png?w=1608&amp;ssl=1 1608w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>There’s a ton of other good things to keep in mind in this post, so it’s definitely worth reading for the most up-to-date info on the subject.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Dark mode ♥️ variable fonts</h3>



<p>We published a neat trick for improving legibility in dark mode: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-and-variable-fonts/">slightly changing the text weight with a variable font</a>. It’s just a tiny bit of code that might something like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  font-weight: 400;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    font-weight: 350;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>But that has a big impact on the reading experience as you can see from this example:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Comparison2.png?fit=1024%2C372&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307647" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Comparison2.png?w=1475&amp;ssl=1 1475w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Comparison2.png?resize=300%2C109&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Comparison2.png?resize=1024%2C372&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Comparison2.png?resize=768%2C279&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Comparison2.png?resize=1000%2C363&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h3>Speaking of fonts, here’s a look at accessible font sizing</h3>



<p>Andrés Galante looks at all the things we need to take into consideration when <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/">designing accesible text on the web</a>. Is the type too light or too dark? Or too small or too big? Is the color of the text good for reading long blocks of text?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Frame-1-1-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-307648" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>My extra hot tip here would be to think about the distance between the screen and the reader. That’s often hard to do when we’re developing on a laptop or bigger screens, so it’s best to test as many devices as we get our mitts on.</p>

<p>Let’s leave you with this one: <a href="https://blurha.sh/">BlurHash</a></p>



<p>Are you familiar with the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images/">“blur up” technique</a>? The idea is that we’re lazy loading images, but rather than showing <code>nothing</code> before the image loads, you show a blurred version of the image you’re about to load. The blurred version being much, much smaller and less of a performance concern. This library makes the blurry images from only about 20 characters pre-saved and renders them to a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Howdy y’all!</p>



<p><strong>[Robin]</strong>: This week I got <em>really</em> weird with it.

<p>I’ve been making this thing with <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> which is “an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.” What you do is write bits of text and then connect them together in their app or on their website:</p>

<p>Then you can export a HTML file with all the markup, styles, and JavaScript bundled inside it. And there you have it: a custom made text adventure game. I knew all I had to do after the export was edit the styles to make it look the way I wanted and then: boom!</p>



<p>My realization this weekend whilst hacking away on this thing isn’t anything <em>technical</em>. It was something else. I knew that <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">a website can be a worry stone</a>, something you throw all your anxiety and stress at. But I didn’t know that a website can be a gift as well. 🎁</p>

<h3>Here’s 6 HTML elements you should probably use more</h3>



<p>Timothy Miller’s <a href="https://timothymiller.dev/posts/2020/html5-elements-i-should-use-more/">list of elements</a> is a good reminder that HTML is, as Timothy puts it, “a large language, but not a <em>massive language</em>.” His list: <code>address</code>, <code>details</code>, <code>dialog</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>abbr</code> and <code>template</code>.</p>



<p>It’s also a good reminder that we should think twice about using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Is this an element just for styling? Then sure, that’s okay. But if this element has meaning then we should probably take a minute to think about it.</p>

<h3>Lookin’ for a new challenge?</h3>



<p>Front-end challenges are a great way to level up as a developer and learn a diverse set of skills—I know that I’ve always found that building something, anything, is more helpful than sitting around theorizing about things. So Chris made <a href="https://css-tricks.com/front-end-challenges/">a handy list of sites</a> that challenge you a bit.</p>



<p>There’s <a href="https://piccalil.li/category/front-end%20challenges%20club/">Front-end challenges club</a> and <a href="https://100dayscss.com">100 days of CSS</a>, or <a href="https://www.dailyui.co/">Daily UI</a> if you’re interested in learning more about the design side of things.</p>

<h3>Pseudo-Randomly Adding Illustrations with CSS</h3>



<p>That’s just what Eric Meyer has done with <a href="https://meyerweb.com">his website redesign</a>, where between each post on his blog one of five of these illustrations below. They really are quite lovely:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?fit=1024%2C554&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307151" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?resize=1024%2C554&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?resize=768%2C416&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?resize=1536%2C831&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM-1.png?resize=1000%2C541&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>



<p>Eric uses the <code>nth-of-type</code> CSS property to switch out each image like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.entry:nth-of-type(2n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-1.png);
}

.entry:nth-of-type(3n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-2.png);
}

.entry:nth-of-type(4n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-3.png);
}

.entry:nth-of-type(5n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-4.png);
}</code></pre>



<p>If these formulas look like a little intense then not to worry! A while back we made a website called <code>:nth Tester</code> that gives you a good visualization of which child is selected depending on what you pass into it:</p>

<h3>Better form inputs for better mobile experiences!</h3>



<p>Alex Holachek writes about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/better-form-inputs-for-better-mobile-user-experiences/">a simple, practical way</a> to make apps perform better on mobile devices:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…always configure HTML input fields with the correct <code>type</code>, <code>inputmode</code>, and <code>autocomplete</code> attributes. While these three attributes are often discussed in isolation, they make the most sense in the context of mobile user experience when you think of them as a team.</p></blockquote>



<p>Alex makes a great point here! So much so that I’ve started noticing when web apps have configured these things incorrectly and now I tend to sigh at a deafening level when hiccups like these get in my way. Forms should be quick, easy to fill-in, and painless. And everything we can do to make that experience easier for everyone involved is absolutely worth doing.</p>



<p>On this note, Alex then went ahead and created completely kick ass website that lets you experiment with the different <code>type</code> values for inputs and how these work across iOS and Android:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?fit=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307153" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?w=2126&amp;ssl=1 2126w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?resize=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?resize=1536%2C1056&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?resize=2048%2C1408&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.16.05-PM.png?resize=1000%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" width="560" style="max-width: 100%;"/></figure>

<h3>A few handy tips for making themable UIs</h3>



<p>Dieter Raber tackles something that I’ve struggled with quite a few times when it comes to working on big design systems: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-color-themes-with-custom-properties-hsl-and-a-little-calc/">how to create color themes</a>. And he does this just by changing the hue of the color with HSL, that’s another way to define a color just like RGB.</p>



<p>Dieter then makes the following example with a magic sprinkling of CSS variables and a dash of JavaScript:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iXL3TMw6.png?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-307154" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iXL3TMw6.png?w=993&amp;ssl=1 993w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iXL3TMw6.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iXL3TMw6.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>I’ve made giant spaghetti codebases in the past by using plain old Sass to create variants of the same UI and so it’s posts like this that make me genuinely thankful how much work has gone into this side of things.</p>

<h3>An introduction to web components</h3>



<p>I’ve yet to use web components at all yet — either in production or as a test just for myself — but I intend to fix that this week by reading all about them in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-web-components/">this excellent tutorial</a> by Caleb Williams. He dives into Custom Elements (I some idea?), Shadow DOM (please don’t ask me) and HTML templates (I’m going to go for a walk now, good day sir!).</p>



<p>This is a good reminder that the web is <em>gigantic</em> and knowing everything about everything isn’t really important and neither is feeling guilty for not knowing stuff. Being curious <em>is</em> important though. And that we can fix.</p>

<p><strong>[Chris]</strong>: Let’s end with an quick opinion piece by Kev Quirk: <strong><a href="https://kevq.uk/why-i-dont-use-a-static-site-generator/">Why I Don’t Use A Static Site Generator</a></strong>. Kev uses WordPress:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Want to <a href="https://kevq.uk/writing-on-my-ipad/">blog on my iPad</a>? I can. Want to do it on my phone? No problem. On a machine I don’t normally use? Not an issue, as long as it has a browser.</p></blockquote>



<p>First, I should note that by using WordPress it doesn’t opt you out of also using a static site generator. WordPress has an API, and that opens the door to hit that API during a build process and build your site that way. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-wordpress/">That’s what Gatsby does.</a> </p>



<p>But I also agree with Kev on a fundamental level. For every reason that he lists, and 1,000 more, it’s a perfectly acceptable and often smart choice to run a WordPress site. I think about it in terms of robustness. WordPress will cover every need you have now and every need that might come up. Need eCommerce? It’s there. Need forms? There are great plugins. Need to augment how the CMS works? You have control over the types of content and what is in them. Need auth? That’s a core feature. Wish you had a great editing experience? Gutenberg is glorious. </p>



<p>Compared to the relatively new world of static sites, every little thing you need can end up a journey of research and implementation, like you’re the 3rd person on Earth to ever do it. </p>



<p>Now all that said, what do I think of static site generators? They are awesome. I think there is a lot to be said about building sites in this way. The decoupling of data and front-end is smart. The security is great. The DX, what with the deploy previews and git-based everything is great. The speed you get out of the gate is amazing. </p>



<p>I can’t wait for a world where we start <em>really</em> seeing the best of both worlds. </p>

<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.diagonal-box-content {
  transform: skewY(11deg);
}</code></pre>



<p> Then some fancy math is used to handle the padding inside to make sure the content lives in a “safe area”. This is a smart technique that I’m sure I’ll have to use at some point in the future!</p>

<h3>Here’s how to recreate that nifty Netflix animation</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Oi8Y_TWA.gif?w=560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306755" style="max-width: 100%;" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>In this post, Chris Geelhoed has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-re-create-a-nifty-netflix-animation-in-css/">a real smart way of doing this</a>: first up, the focused image uses <code>transform: scale()</code> which makes a bunch of sense — but each of those items to the side? That’s done by shifting every item to the left and then every item <em>after</em> the hovered element to the right, like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item:hover ~ .item {
  transform: translateX(25%);
}</code></pre>

<h3>Some tips for writing animation code efficiently</h3>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/tips-for-writing-animation-code-efficiently/">Zach Saucier recommends</a> a bunch of techniques and best practices, such as using an animation library like the Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP). I particularly like the suggestion to use the <a href="https://greensock.com/morphsvg/?ref=30488">MorphSVG</a> plugin which does just what it sounds like, helping us morph SVG paths by animating them together.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of what that looks like:</p>

<h3>When debugging, your attitude matters</h3>



<p>In <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/">this great post</a> on the subject, Julia Evans argues just that and how on a recent project she found that her process wasn’t helping at all:</p>



<blockquote><p>While I was debugging my CSS, I noticed myself doing some bad things that I normally would not! I was:</p>
<ul><li>making random changes to my code in the hopes that it would work</li><li>googling a lot of things and trying them without understanding what they did</li><li>if something broke, reverting my changes and starting again</li></ul>
<p>This strategy was exactly as effective as you might imagine (not very effective!), and it was because of my attitude about CSS! I had this unusual-for-me belief that CSS was Too Hard and impossible for me to understand. So let’s talk about that attitude a bit!</p></blockquote>



<p>I think my advice here (that I would give to myself too because I constantly do this stuff as well), is to make tiny prototypes all the time. Whenever there’s a thing that I don’t understand with CSS I tend to quickly open up a new pen by going to <code>codepen.io/pen</code> and then experimenting with it in there. I don’t care if anyone sees that code or whether it’s beautiful, it’s just about understanding how this one thing works. </p>



<p>Chris wrote about this some time ago when he mentioned <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/">reduced test cases</a>: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A reduced test case is a demo/example page you create which reproduces the problem you are having with the least amount of code possible. Only the HTML needed to show the problem content. Only CSS that is related to that reduced HTML. Only the JavaScript related to the problem functionality at hand.</p><p>Reduced test cases are the absolute, no doubt about it, number one way to troubleshoot bugs. </p></blockquote>

<h3>Learn Eleventy from Scratch</h3>



<p>You might’ve heard about <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, the ever-so-excellent static site generator—it’s great for making super fast, lightweight websites and Andy Bell will show us all how to do just that with <a href="https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/">this online course</a>. He writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In this course, you’ll start with an empty directory. At the end of the course, you’ll have a sparkling new website that packs a mighty punch with a tiny footprint.</p><p>It’s a written course, so you can work at it in your own pace, take the code samples and importantly, work through it offline.</p></blockquote>



<p>I have a bunch of side projects setup with Eleventy already but I’m sure Andy will have plenty to teach me anywho.</p>

<h3>Do you know about remove.bg?</h3>



<p>Somehow I always tend to forget it exists, but it’s <a href="https://www.remove.bg/">an extremely handy service</a> that removes the background of an image. The other day I realized they also have <a href="https://www.remove.bg/windows-mac-linux">desktop apps</a> so I can quickly throw an image into it and move on with things quickly without having to visit the site.</p>



<p>It’s so dang helpful that I cannot recommend downloading the app highly enough, I’ve used it half a dozen times this week alone.</p>
