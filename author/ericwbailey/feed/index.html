<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Like <a href="http://my-codeworks.com/blog/2015/css3-proven-to-be-turing-complete">any other programming language</a>, CSS has functions. They can be inserted where you’d place a value, or in some cases, accompanying another value declaration. Some CSS functions even let you nest other functions within them!</p>



<details><summary>More</summary>



<p>In programming, functions are a named portion of code that performs a specific task. An example of this could be a function written in JavaScript called <code>sayWoof():</code></p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">function sayWoof() {
  console.log("Woof!");
}</code></pre>



<p>We can use this function later in our code, after we have defined our desired behavior. For this example, any time you type <code>sayWoof()</code> in your website or web app&#8217;s JavaScript it will print “Woof!” into the browser’s console.</p>



<p>Functions can also use arguments, which are slots for things like numbers or bits of text that you can feed into the function’s logic to have it modify them. It works like this in JavaScript:</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">function countDogs(amount) {
  console.log("There are " + amount + " dogs!");
}</code></pre>



<p>Here, we have a function called <code>countDogs()</code> that has an argument called <code>amount</code>. When a number is provided for amount, it will take that number and add it to a pre-specified sentence. This lets us create sentences that tell us how many dogs we’ve counted.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">countDogs(3); // There are 3 dogs!
countDogs(276); // There are 276 dogs!
countDogs("many"); // There are many dogs!</code></pre>



<p>Some programming languages come with baked-in functions to help prevent you from having to reinvent the wheel for every new project. Typically, these functions are built to help make working with the main strengths and features of the language easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take libraries, for example. Libraries are collections of opinionated code made to help make development faster and easier, effectively just curated function collections&nbsp;—&nbsp;think <a href="http://fitvidsjs.com">FitVids.js</a> for creating flexible video elements.</p>

<h3><strong>Basics of CSS Functions</strong></h3>

<p>Unlike other programming languages, we cannot create our own functions in CSS, per se. That kind of logic is reserved for <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048">CSS selectors</a>, which allow you to create <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/quantity-queries-for-css">powerful conditional styling rules</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As opposed to other programming languages — where the output of a function typically invisibly affects other logic down the line — the output of CSS functions are visual in nature. This output is used to control both layout and presentation of content. For example:&nbsp;</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.has-orange-glow {
  filter: drop-shadow(0.25rem 0 0.75rem #ef9035);
}</code></pre>



<p>The <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/The-functions-of-CSS--AaYBhHD90yG9woSppCLf~j7XAg-ml1WvA6P7hSbkzeOM1Yhm%23:h2=drop-shadow()">CSS filter function <code>drop-shadow()</code></a> uses the arguments we provide it to create an orange outer glow effect on whatever it is applied to.</p>



<p>In the following demo, I have a JavaScript function named <code>toggleOrangeGlow</code> that toggles the application of the class <code>.has-orange-glow</code> on the CSS-Tricks logo. Combining this with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition">CSS transition</a>, we’re able to create a cool glowing effect:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_wOrzeG" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/wOrzeG?height=350&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=wOrzeG&amp;default-tab=result" height="350" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed wOrzeG" title="CodePen Embed wOrzeG" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>You may be familiar with some CSS functions, but the language has a surprisingly expansive list!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="explanation">Much like any other technology on the web, different CSS functions have different levels of browser support. Make sure you <a href="https://caniuse.com/">research and test</a> to ensure your experience works for everyone, and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-supports-works/">use things like <code>@supports</code></a> to provide quality alternate experiences.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>Common CSS Functions</h3>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>url()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  background: url(/images/image.jpg);
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>Using <code>url()</code></summary>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_GLjOKX" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/GLjOKX?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GLjOKX&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed GLjOKX" title="CodePen Embed GLjOKX" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p><code>url()</code> allows you to link to other resources to load them. This can include images, fonts, and even other stylesheets. For performance reasons, it’s good practice to limit the things you load via <code>url()</code>, as each declaration is an additional HTTP request.</p>
</div></div>



</details>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>attr()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* &lt;div data-example="foo"> */
div {
  content: attr(data-example);
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>Using <code>attr()</code></summary>



<p>This function allows us to reach into HTML, snag an attribute’s content, and feed it to the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content">content property</a>. You’ll commonly see <code>attr()</code> used in <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/i-totally-forgot-about-print-style-sheets-f1e6604cfd6">print stylesheets</a>, where it is used to show the URL of a link after its text. Another great application of this function is using it to <a href="https://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/">show the alt description of an image</a> if it fails to load.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_wZWmpK" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/wZWmpK?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=wZWmpK&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed wZWmpK" title="CodePen Embed wZWmpK" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



</details>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>calc()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  width: calc(100vw - 80px);
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>Using <code>calc()</code></summary>



<p>If there’s one function you should spend some time experimenting with, it’s <code>calc()</code>. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/">We have a complete guide just on <code>calc()</code></a>.</p>



<p>This function takes two arguments and calculates a result from the operator (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>) you supply it, provided those arguments are numbers with or without an accompanying <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/">unit</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_jRMawb" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/jRMawb?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=jRMawb&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed jRMawb" title="CodePen Embed jRMawb" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Unlike CSS preprocessors such as <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <code>calc()</code> can mix units, meaning you can do things like subtract <code>6rem</code> from <code>100%</code>. <code>calc()</code> is also updated on the fly, so if that <code>100%</code> represents a width, it’ll still work if that width changes. <code>calc()</code> can also <a href="https://css-tricks.com/making-custom-properties-css-variables-dynamic/">accept CSS Custom Properties as arguments</a>, allowing you an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-color-themes-with-custom-properties-hsl-and-a-little-calc/">incredible degree of flexibility</a>.&nbsp;</p>



</details>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>lang()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">p:lang(en) {
  quotes: "\201C" "\201D" "\2018" "\2019" "\201C" "\201D" "\2018" "\2019";
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>Using <code>lang()</code></summary>



<p><a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/use-the-lang-attribute-for-better-accessibility--cms-31961">Including a <code>lang</code> attribute</a> in your HTML is a really important thing to do. When present in your HTML, you’re able to use the <code>lang()</code> function to target the presence of the attribute’s value and conditionally apply styling based on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One common use for this selector is to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:lang%23Example">set language-specific quotes</a>, which is great for things like internationalization.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_XQNEYM" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/XQNEYM?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=XQNEYM&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed XQNEYM" title="CodePen Embed XQNEYM" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Clever designers and developers might also use it as a hook for styling translated versions of their sites, where cultural and/or language considerations mean there’s <a href="https://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/">different perceptions about things like negative space</a>.</p>



</details>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>:not()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">h3:not(:first-child) {
  margin-top: 0;
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>Using <code>:not()</code></summary>



<p>This pseudo-class selector will select anything that <em>isn’t</em> what you specify. For example, you could target anything that isn’t an image with <code>body:not(img)</code>. While this example is dangerously powerful, scoping <code>:not()</code> to more focused selectors such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">BEM’s block class</a> can give you a great deal of versatility.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_rEmvEx" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/rEmvEx?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=rEmvEx&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed rEmvEx" title="CodePen Embed rEmvEx" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Currently, <code>:not()</code> supports only one selector for its argument, but support for multiple comma-separated arguments (e.g. <code>div:not(.this, .that)</code>) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/%23changes-level-3">is being worked on</a>!</p>



</details>
</div></div>



<p></p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>CSS Custom Properties</h3>



<p>There is only one function specific to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/guides/css-custom-properties/">CSS custom properties</a>, but it makes the whole thing tick! </p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>The<code>var()</code> function is used to reference a custom property declared earlier in the document.&nbsp;</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">html {
  --color: orange;
}

p {
  color: var(--color);
}</code></pre>



<p>It is incredibly powerful when combined with <code>calc()</code>.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">html {
  --scale: 1.2;
  --size: 0.8rem;
}

.size-2 {
  font-size: calc(var(--size) * var(--scale));
}
.size-2 {
  font-size: calc(var(--size) * var(--scale) * var(--scale));
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>More about using <code>var()</code></summary>



<p>Another example of this is declaring a custom property called <code>--ratio: 1.618</code>; in the root of the document, then invoking it later in our CSS to control line-height, like <code>line-height: var(--ratio);</code>. </p>



<p>Here, <code>var()</code> is a set of instructions that tells the browser, “Go find the argument called <code>--ratio</code> declared earlier in the document, take its value, and apply it here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember! <code>calc()</code> lets us dynamically adjust things on the fly, including the argument you supply via <code>var()</code>. </p>



<p>This allows us to create things like <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography">modular scale systems</a> directly in CSS with just a few lines of code. If you change the value of <code>--ratio</code>, the whole modular scale system will update to match.</p>



<p>In the following CodePen demo, I’ve done exactly just that. Change the value of <code>--scale</code> in the Pen’s CSS to a different number to see what I mean:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_NJwYoV" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/NJwYoV?height=500&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=NJwYoV&amp;default-tab=result" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed NJwYoV" title="CodePen Embed NJwYoV" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/setProperty"><code>setProperty</code></a> method can update custom properties in real time. This allows us to quickly and efficiently make dynamic changes to things that previously might have required a lot of complicated code to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



</details>
</div></div>

<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>Color Functions</h3>



<p>Another common place you see CSS functions is when working with color.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>rgb()</code> and <code>rgba()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
  color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
  color: rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5);
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>Using <code>rgb()</code></summary>



<p>These functions allow you to use numbers to describe the red (<code>r</code>), green (<code>g</code>), blue (<code>b</code>), and alpha (<code>a</code>) levels of a color. For example, a red color with a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors%23Hex_triplet">hex value</a> of <code>#fb1010</code> could also be described as <code>rgba(251, 16, 16, 1)</code>. The red value, <code>251</code>, is far higher than the green and blue values (<code>16</code> and <code>16</code>), as the color is mostly comprised of red information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The alpha value of 1 means that it is fully opaque, and won’t show anything behind what the color is applied to. If we change the alpha value to be 0.5, the color will be 50% transparent. If you use an <code>rgb()</code> function instead of <code>rgba()</code>, you don’t have to supply an alpha value. This used to mean you couldn&#8217;t supply an alpha value, but that function will take one now whether you use the old comma-syntax or the new slash-syntax.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QXOXWz" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QXOXWz?height=500&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QXOXWz&amp;default-tab=result" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QXOXWz" title="CodePen Embed QXOXWz" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



</details>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>hsl()</code> and <code>hsla()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  background: hsl(100, 100%, 50%);
  background: hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  background: hsl(100 100% 50% / 0.5);
}</code></pre>



<details><summary>More about using <code>hsl()</code></summary>



<p>Similar to <code>rgb()</code> and <code>rgba()</code>, <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hsla()</code> are functions that allow you to describe color. Instead of using red, green, and blue, they use hue (<code>h</code>), saturation (<code>s</code>), and lightness (<code>l</code>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I prefer using <code>hsla()</code> over <code>rgba()</code> because its model of describing color <a href="https://css-tricks.com/hsl-hsla-is-great-for-programmatic-color-control/">works really well with systematized color systems</a>. Each of the color level values for these functions can be CSS Custom Properties, allowing you to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/do-css-custom-properties-beat-sass-loops/">create powerful, dynamic code</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ydvqXw" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ydvqXw?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ydvqXw&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ydvqXw" title="CodePen Embed ydvqXw" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



</details>
</div></div>



<h4>New Color Functions</h4>



<p>In the upcoming <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/">CSS Color Module Level 4</a> spec, we can ignore the <code>a</code> portion of <code>rgba()</code> and <code>hsla()</code>, as well as the commas. Now, spaces are used to separate the <code>rgb</code> and <code>hsl</code> arguments, with an optional <code>/</code> to indicate an alpha level.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll also start seeing new functions like <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> that will use this new format</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>Pseudo Class Selector Functions</h3>



<p>These selectors use specialized argument notation that specifies <a href="http://www.topdesignagencies.com/nth-test/">patterns of what to select</a>. This allows you to do things like select every other element, every fifth element, every third element after the seventh element, etc.</p>



<p>Pseudo class selectors are incredibly versatile, yet often overlooked and under-appreciated. Many times, <a href="http://quantityqueries.com/">a thoughtful application</a> of a few of these selectors can do the work of one or more node packages.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>:nth-child()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el:nth-child(3n) {
  background-color: #eee;
}</code></pre>



<p><code>nth-child()</code> allows you to target one or more of the elements present in a group of elements that are on the same level in the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.</p>

<p>In the right hands, <code>:nth-child()</code> is incredibly powerful. You can even <a href="https://codepen.io/cobra_winfrey/pen/yrVOwm">solve fizzbuzz with it</a>! If you&#8217;re looking for a good way to get started, Chris has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/useful-nth-child-recipies/">a collection useful pseudo selector recipes</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>:nth-last-child()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el:nth-last-child(2) {
  opacity: 0.75;
}
.el:last-child {
  opacity: 0.5;
}</code></pre>



<p>This pseudo class selector targets elements in a group of one or more elements that are on the same level in the DOM. It starts counting from the last element in the group and works backwards through the list of available DOM nodes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ydXNwV" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ydXNwV?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ydXNwV&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ydXNwV" title="CodePen Embed ydXNwV" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>:nth-of-type()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">h2:nth-of-type(odd) {
  text-indent: 3rem;
}</code></pre>



<p><code>:nth-of-type()</code> matches a specified collection of elements of a given type. For example, a declaration of <code>img:nth-of-type(5)</code> would target the fifth image on a page.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ydPYRJ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ydPYRJ?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ydPYRJ&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ydPYRJ" title="CodePen Embed ydPYRJ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

}</code></pre>



<p>This pseudo class selector can target an element in a group of elements of a similar type. Much like <code>:nth-last-child()</code>, it starts counting from the last element in the group. Unlike <code>:nth-last-child</code>, it will skip elements that don’t apply as it works backwards.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Animation Functions</h3>



<p>Animation is an important part of adding that certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to your website or web app. Just remember to put your users’ needs first and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/">honor their</a> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/">animation preferences</a>.</p>



<p>Creating animations also requires controlling the state of things over time, so functions are a natural fit for making that happen.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>cubic-bezier()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {

}</code></pre>



<p>Instead of keyword values like <code>ease</code>, <code>ease-in-out</code>, or <code>linear</code>, you can use <code>cubic-bezier()</code> to create a custom timing function for your animation. While you can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/timing-function">read about the math that powers cubic beziers</a>, I think it&#8217;s much more fun to <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/">play around with making one</a> instead.</p>

}
.move-me {

<p>This function is paired with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/offset-path/">the <code>offset-path</code> property</a> (or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/an-initial-implementation-of-clip-path-path/">eventually</a>, the <code>clip-path</code> property). It allows you to “draw” a SVG path that other elements can be animated to follow.</p>

<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {

<p>This relatively new function allows you to set the easing timing across an animation, which allows for a greater degree of control over what part of the animation occurs when.

<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>Sizing &amp; Scaling Functions</h3>



<p>One common thing we do with animation is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_and_stretch">stretch and squash stuff</a>. The following functions allow you to do exactly that. There is a catch, however: These CSS functions are a special subset, in that they can only work with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/">the <code>transform</code> property</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>scaleX()</code>, <code>scaleY()</code>, <code>scaleZ()</code>, <code>scale3d()</code>, and <code>scale()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.double {
  transform: scale(2);
}</code></pre>



<p>Scaling functions let you increase or decrease the size of something along one or more axes. If you use <code>scale3d()</code> you can even do this in three dimensions!</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>translateX()</code>, <code>translateY()</code>, <code>translateZ()</code>, <code>translate3d()</code>, and <code>translate()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.center {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}</code></pre>



<p>Translate functions let you reposition an element along one or more axes. Much like scale functions, you can also extend this manipulation into three dimensions.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>perspective()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.cube {
  transform: perspective(50em) rotateY(50deg)
}</code></pre>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/perspective/">This function</a> lets you adjust the appearance of an object to make it look like it is projecting up and out from its background.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>rotateX()</code>, <code>rotateY()</code>, <code>rotateZ()</code>, <code>rotate3d()</code>, and <code>rotate()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.avatar {
  transform: rotate(25deg);
}</code></pre>



<p>Rotate functions let you swivel an element along one or more axes, much like grasping a ball and turning it around in your hand.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>skewX()</code>, <code>skewY()</code>, and <code>skew()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.header {
  transform: skew(25deg, 15deg);
}</code></pre>



<p>Skew functions are a little different from scaling and rotation functions in that they apply a distortion effect relative to a single point. The amount of distortion is proportionate to the angle and distance declared, meaning that the further the effect continues in a direction the more pronounced it will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alterebro">Jorge Moreno</a> also did us all a favor and made a great tool called <a href="https://css-transform.moro.es/">CSS Transform Functions Visualizer</a>. It allows you to adjust sizing and scaling in real time to better understand how all these functions work together:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>
</div></div>



<p>As responsible web professionals, we should be mindful of our users and the fact that they may not be using new or powerful hardware to view our content. Large and complicated animations may slow down the experience, or even cause the browser to crash in extreme scenarios.</p>



<p>To prevent this, we can use techniques like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/w/will-change/"><code>will-change</code></a> to <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/">prepare the browser for what’s in store</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/update-frequency">the <code>update</code> media feature</a> to remove animation on devices that do not support a fast refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>Filter Functions</h3>



<p>CSS filter functions are another special subset of CSS functions, in that they can only work with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/">the <code>filter</code> property</a>. Filters are special effects applied to an element, <a href="https://www.cssfilters.co/">mimicking functionality of graphics editing programs</a> such as Photoshop.</p>



<p>You can do some really wild things with CSS filter functions, stuff like <a href="https://una.im/CSSgram/">recreating the effects you can apply to your posts on Instagram</a>! </p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>brightness()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.avatar:hover {
  filter: brightness(150%);
}</code></pre>



<p>This function adjusts how, um, bright something appears. Setting it to a low level will make it appear as if it has had a shadow cast over it. Setting it to a high level will blow it out, like an over-exposed photo.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_RzQYRB" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/RzQYRB?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=RzQYRB&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed RzQYRB" title="CodePen Embed RzQYRB" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>blur()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.ghost {
  filter: blur(50%);
}</code></pre>



<p>If you’re familiar with Photoshop’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">Gaussian Blur</a> filter, you know how <code>blur()</code> works. The more of this you apply, the more indistinct the thing you apply it to will look.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_KjqaEZ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/KjqaEZ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=KjqaEZ&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed KjqaEZ" title="CodePen Embed KjqaEZ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<h4><code>contrast()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.wow {
  filter: contrast(200%);
}</code></pre>



<p><code>contrast()</code> will adjust the degree of difference between the lightest and darkest parts of what is applied to.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ewKxeB" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ewKxeB?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ewKxeB&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ewKxeB" title="CodePen Embed ewKxeB" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>grayscale()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.no-color {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}</code></pre>



<p><code>grayscale()</code> removes the color information from what it is applied to. Remember that this isn’t an all-or-nothing affair! You can apply a partial grayscale effect to make something look weathered or washed out.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_vqWOKX" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/vqWOKX?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=vqWOKX&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed vqWOKX" title="CodePen Embed vqWOKX" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>An interesting application of <code>grayscale()</code> could be <a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/re-colorization-for-dark-mode-19e2e17b584b">lightly applying it to images when dark mode is enabled</a>, to slightly diminish the overall vibrancy of color in a situation where the user may want less eye strain.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>invert()</code></h4>



<p>While <code>invert()</code> can be used to make something look like a photo negative, my favorite technique is to use it in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/inverted-colors">inverted colors media query</a> to invert inverted images and video:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@media (inverted-colors: inverted) {
  img,
  video {
    filter: invert(100%);
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This ensures that image and video content looks the way it should, regardless of a user’s expressed browsing mode preferences.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><strong><code>opacity()</code></strong></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.filter-visibility {
  filter: opacity(0);
}</code></pre>



<p>This function controls how much of the background is visible through the element (and child elements) the function is applied to.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_NZgwrx" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/NZgwrx?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=NZgwrx&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed NZgwrx" title="CodePen Embed NZgwrx" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>An element that has 0% opacity will be completely transparent, although it will still be present in the DOM. If you need to remove an object completely, use other techniques such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden">the hidden attribute</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><strong><code>saturate()</code></strong></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.full-color {
  filter: saturate(100%);
}</code></pre>



<p>Applying this filter can enhance, or decrease the intensity of the color of what it is applied to. Enhancing an image’s saturation is a common technique photographers use to fix underexposed photos.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_pXZZgN" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/pXZZgN?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=pXZZgN&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed pXZZgN" title="CodePen Embed pXZZgN" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.is-old-timey {

<p>There are fancier ways to describe this, but realistically it’s a function that makes something look like it’s an old-timey photograph.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_YorzgM" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/YorzgM?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=YorzgM&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed YorzgM" title="CodePen Embed YorzgM" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

  filter: drop-shadow(3rem 0 0.5rem #e486da);
}</code></pre>



<p>A drop shadow is a visual effect applied to an object that makes it appear like it is hovering off of the page. There’s a bit of a trick here, in that CSS also allows you to apply drop shadow effects to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow">text</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow">elements</a>. It’s also distinct from the box-shadow property is that<a href="https://css-tricks.com/breaking-css-box-shadow-vs-drop-shadow/"> it applies drop shadows to the shape of an element</a> rather than the actual box of an element.</p>



<p>Skilled designers and developers can take advantage of this to create complicated visual effects.</p>

<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.change-color {
  filter: hue-rotate(180deg);
}</code></pre>



<p>When a class with a declaration containing hue-rotate() is applied to an element, each pixel used to draw that element will have it’s hue valued shifted by the amount you specify. <code>hue-rotate()</code>&#8216;s effect is applied to each and every pixel it is applied to, so all colors will update relative to their hue value’s starting point. </p>



<p>This can create a really psychedelic effect when applied to things that contain a lot of color information, such as photos.</p>

<h3>Gradient Functions</h3>



<p>Gradients are created when you transition one color to one or more other colors. They are workhorses of modern user interfaces — skilled designers and developers use them to lend an air of polish and sophistication to their work.</p>



<p>Gradient functions allow you to specify a whole range of properties, including:</p>



<ul><li>Color values,</li><li>The position on the gradient area where that color comes in,</li><li>What angle the gradient is positioned at.</li></ul>



<p>And yes, you guessed it: the colors we use in a gradient can be described using CSS color functions!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>linear-gradient()</code> and <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code></h4>



<p>Linear gradients apply the color transformation in a straight line, from one point to another — this line can be set at an angle as well. In cases where there’s more area than gradient, using <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code> will, er, repeat the gradient you described until all the available area has been filled.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_dBjqMo" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/dBjqMo?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=dBjqMo&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed dBjqMo" title="CodePen Embed dBjqMo" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>radial-gradient()</code> and <code>repeating-radial-gradient()</code></h4>



<p>Radial gradients are a lot like linear gradients, only instead of a straight line, color transformations radiate outward from a center point. They’re oftentimes used to create a semitransparent screen to help separate a modal from the background it is placed over.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_orPLrR" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/orPLrR?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=orPLrR&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed orPLrR" title="CodePen Embed orPLrR" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>conic-gradient()</code> and <code>repeating-conical-gradient</code></h4>



<p>Conic gradients are different from radial gradients in that the color <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-conic-gradient/">rotates around a circle</a>. Because of this, we can do neat things like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-conic-gradients-css-variables-create-doughnut-chart-output-range-input/">create donut charts</a>.

<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list">
<h3>Grid Functions</h3>



<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">CSS Grid</a> is a relatively new feature of the language. It allows us to efficiently create adaptive, robust layouts for multiple screen sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth acknowledging our roots. Before Grid, layout in CSS was largely a series of codified hacks to work with a language originally designed to format academic documents. Grid’s introduction is further acknowledgement that the language’s intent has changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern CSS is an efficient, fault-tolerant language for controlling presentation and layout across a wide range of device form factors. Equipped with Grid and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/">other properties like flexbox</a>, we’re able to create layouts that would have been impossible to create in earlier iterations of CSS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grid introduces the following CSS functions to help you use it.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>fit-content()</code></h4>



<p>This function “clamps” the size of grid rows or columns, letting you specify a maximum size a grid track can expand to. <code>fit-content()</code> accepts a range of values, but most notable among them are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width%23Values"><code>min-content</code> and <code>max-content</code></a>. These values allow you to tie your layout to the content it contains. Impressive stuff!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_wLxEyy" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/wLxEyy?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=wLxEyy&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed wLxEyy" title="CodePen Embed wLxEyy" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>minmax()</code></h4>



<p><code>minmax()</code> allows you to <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/css-grid-layout-minmax/">set the minimum and maximum desired heights and widths</a> of your grid rows and columns. This function can also use <code>min-content</code> and <code>max-content</code>, giving us a great deal of power and flexibility.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_qzMXvO" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/qzMXvO?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=qzMXvO&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed qzMXvO" title="CodePen Embed qzMXvO" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>repeat()</code></h4>



<p>You can loop through patterns of grid column and rows using <code>repeat()</code>. This is great for two scenarios:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>When you <strong>do</strong> know how many rows or columns you need, but typing them out would be laborious. A good example of this would be constructing the grid for a calendar.</li><li>When you <strong>don’t</strong> know how many rows or columns you need. Here, you can specify a template that the browser will honor as it <a href="https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2019-02-23-content-based-grid-tracks-and-embracing-flexibility">propagates content into your layout</a>.</li></ol>

<h3>Shape Functions</h3>



<p>Like <code>filter()</code> and <code>transform()</code>, shape CSS functions only work with one property: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path"><code>clip-path</code></a>. This property is used to mask portions of something, allowing you to create <a href="https://css-tricks.com/tag/clip-path/">all sorts of cool effects</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>circle()</code></h4>



<p>This function creates a circular shape for your mask, allowing you to specify its radius and position.</p>

</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>ellipse()</code></h4>



<p>Like <code>circle()</code>, <code>ellipse()</code> will draw a rounded shape, only instead of a perfect circle, <code>ellipse()</code> lets you construct an oblong mask.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><strong><code>polygon()</code></strong></h4>



<p>With <code>polygon()</code>, you are able to specify an arbitrary number of points, allowing you to draw complicated shapes. <code>polygon()</code> also takes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule">an optional <code>fill-rule</code> argument</a>, which specifies which part of the shape is the inside part.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Functions</h3>



<p>These are the un-categorizable CSS functions, things that don’t fit neatly elsewhere.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>element()</code></h4>



<p>Ever pointed a camera at its own video feed? That’s sort of what <code>element()</code> does. It allows you to specify the ID of another element to create an &#8220;image&#8221; of what that element looks like. You can then apply other CSS to that image, including stuff like CSS filters!</p>



<p>It might take a bit to wrap your head around the concept — and it has <a href="https://caniuse.com/%23feat=css-element-function">some support concerns</a> — but <code>element()</code> is a potentially very powerful in the right hands. </p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rpsthecoder">Preethi Sam</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-the-little-known-css-element-function-to-create-a-minimap-navigator/">&#8220;Using the Little-Known CSS element() Function to Create a Minimap Navigator&#8221;</a> demonstrates how to use it to create a code minimap and is an excellent read. </p>

    );
}</code></pre>



<p>This function allows you to specify a list of images for the browser to select for a background image, based on what it knows about the capabilities of its display and its connection speed. It is analogous to what you would do with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-css/">the <code>srcset</code> property</a>.</p>

<h3>Not Ready for Prime Time</h3>



<p>Like any other living programming language, CSS includes features and functionality that are actively being worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These functions can sometimes be previewed using browsers that have access to the bleeding edge. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/">Firefox Nightly</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Chrome Canary</a> are two such browsers.

<h4><code>annotation()</code></h4>



<p>This function enables Alternate Annotation Forms, characters reserved for marking up things like notation and annotation. These characters typically will be outlined with a circle, square, or diamond shape. </p>



<p>Not many typefaces contain Alternate Annotation Forms, so it’s good to check to see if the typeface you’re using includes them before trying to get <code>annotation()</code> to work. <a href="https://wakamaifondue.com/">Tools such as Wakamai Fondue</a> can help with that.</p>

<h4><code>counter()</code> and <code>counters()</code></h4>



<p>When you create an ordered list in HTML, the browser will automatically generate numbers for you and place them before your list item content. These pieces of browser-generated list content are called counters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using a combination of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker">the <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element selector</a>, the content property, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/counter">the <code>counter()</code> function</a>, we can control the content and presentation of the counters on an ordered list. For browsers that don’t support <code>counter()</code> or <code>counters()</code> yet, you still get a decent experience due to the browser automatically falling back to its generated content:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QXZdgb" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QXZdgb?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QXZdgb&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QXZdgb" title="CodePen Embed QXZdgb" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>For situations where you have nested ordered lists, the <code>counters()</code> function allows a child ordered list to access its parent. This allows us to control their content and presentation. If you want to learn more about the power of <code>::marker</code>, <code>counter(), and counters()</code>, you can read <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/css-lists-markers-counters/">“CSS Lists, Markers, And Counters”</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>dir()</code></h4>



<p>This function allows you to flip the orientation of a language’s reading order. For English, that means a left-to-right (<code>ltr</code>) reading order gets turned into right-to-left (<code>rtl</code>). <a href="https://caniuse.com/%23feat=css-dir-pseudo">Only Firefox currently has support for <code>dir()</code></a>, but you can achieve the same effect in Chromium-based browsers by using an attribute selector such as <code>[dir="rtl"]</code>.</p>

<p>That being said, device sniffing is a fallacious affair — you shouldn’t consider <code>env()</code> a way to cheat it. Instead, use it as intended: to make sure your design works for devices that impose unique hardware constraints on the viewport.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>has()</code></h4>



<p><code>has()</code> is a relational pseudo-class that will target an element that contains another element, provided there is at least one match in the HTML source. An example of this is be <code>a:has(&gt; img)</code>, which tells the browser to target any link that contains an image.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?fit=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1" alt="A diagram showing how the CSS selector a:has(&gt; img) targets only links that contain images in a collection of links that contain either images or paragraphs." class="wp-image-307707" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?w=3635&amp;ssl=1 3635w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?resize=768%2C293&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?resize=1536%2C586&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?resize=2048%2C781&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?resize=1000%2C381&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/l75sROCU.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Interestingly, <code>has()</code> is currently being proposed as CSS you can only write in JavaScript. If I were to wager a guess as to why this is, it is to scope the selector for performance reasons. With this approach <code>has()</code> is triggered only after the browser has been told to process conditional logic, and therefore query the state of things.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>image()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.help::before {
  content: image("try.webp", "try.svg", "try.gif");
}</code></pre>



<p>This function will let you insert either a static image (referenced with <code>url()</code>, or draw one dynamically via gradients and <code>element()</code>.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4>Trigonometry functions</h4>



<p>These functions will allow us to perform more <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/css-to-get-support-for-trigonometry-functions/">advanced mathematical operations</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Sine: <code>sin()</code></li><li>Cosine: <code>cos()</code></li><li>Tangent: <code>tan()</code></li><li><code>Arccosine: acos()</code></li><li>Arcsine: <code>asin()</code></li><li>Arctangent: <code>atan()</code></li><li>Arctangent: <code>atan2()</code></li><li>Square root: <code>sqrt()</code></li><li><code>The square root of the sum of squares of its arguments: hypot()</code></li><li>Power: <code>pow()</code></li></ul>



<p>I’m especially excited to see what people who are more clever than I am will do with these functions, especially for things like animation!</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>clamp()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.page-wrap {
  width: clamp(320px, 80%, 1200px);
}
body {
  font-size: clamp(12px, 1rem + 2vw, 18px);
}</code></pre>



<p>When providing minimum, maximum, and preferred values as arguments, <code>clamp()</code> will honor the preferred value so long as it does not exceed the minimum and maximum boundaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>clamp()</code> will allow us to author things like components whose size will scale along with the size of the viewport, but won’t shrink or grow past a specific size. This will be especially useful for creating <a href="https://blog.typekit.com/2016/08/17/flexible-typography-with-css-locks/">CSS locks</a>, where you can ensure a responsive type size will not get so small that it can’t be read.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>:host()</code> and <code>:host-context()</code></h4>



<p>To be honest, I’m a little hazy on the specifics of the jargon and mechanics that power the Shadow DOM. Here’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host()">how the MDN describes <code>host()</code></a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The <code>:host()</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS </a><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">pseudo-class</a> function selects the shadow host of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM">shadow DOM</a> containing the CSS it is used inside (so you can select a custom element from inside its shadow DOM) — but only if the selector given as the function&#8217;s parameter matches the shadow host.</p></blockquote>



<p>And here’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host-context()">what they have to say about <code>:host-context()</code></a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The <code>:host-context()</code> CSS pseudo-class function selects the shadow host of the shadow DOM containing the CSS it is used inside (so you can select a custom element from inside its shadow DOM) — but only if the selector given as the function&#8217;s parameter matches the shadow host&#8217;s ancestor(s) in the place it sits inside the DOM hierarchy.</p></blockquote>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><strong><code>:is()</code> and <code>:where()</code></strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/i/is/"><code>:is()</code></a> has had a bit of an identity crisis. Previously referred to as both <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3258"><code>matches()</code></a> and vendor prefixed as <code>:-webkit-any</code>/<code>:-moz-any</code>, it now enjoys a standardized, agreed-upon name. It is a pseudo class selector that accepts a range of selectors as its argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allows an author to group and target a wide range of selectors in an efficient way. <code>:where()</code> is much like <code>:is()</code>, only it has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity">specificity</a> of zero, while the specificity of <code>:is()</code> is set to the highest specificity in the provided selector list.&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>:is()</code> and <code>:where()</code> will allow us a good deal of flexibility about how we select things to style, especially for situations where you may not have as much control over the web site or web app’s stylesheet (e.g. third-party integrations, ads, etc).</p>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code></h4>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.minimum-of-these {
  width: max(500px, 50%);
}
.maximum-of-these {
  width: min(320px, 90%);
}</code></pre>



<p>These functions allow you to select either the maximum or minimum value from a range of values you provide. Much like <code>clamp()</code>, these functions allow us to make things responsive up until a certain point.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>:nth-col()</code> and <code>:nth-last-col()</code></h4>



<p>These pseudo-classes will allow you to select one or a specified series columns in a CSS grid to apply styling to them. A good mental model for how these functions will work is how CSS pseudo class selectors operate. Unlike pseudo class selectors, <code>:nth-col()</code> and <code>:nth-last-col()</code> should be able to target <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/%23implicit-grids">implicit grid columns</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>symbols()</code></h4>



<p>This function allows you to specify a list of different kinds of characters to use for list bullets. Much like <code>annotation()</code>, you’ll want to make sure the typeface you use contains a glyph you want to use as a symbol before trying to get <code>symbols()</code> to work.</p>
</div></div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column css-functions-list css-functions-list-deprecated">
<h3>Deprecated Functions</h3>



<p>Sometimes things just don’t work out the way you think they will. While deprecated CSS functions may still render in the browser for legacy support reasons, it isn’t recommended you use them going forward.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>matrix()</code> and <code>matrix3d()</code></h4>



<p>These functions were turned into more discrete <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/The-functions-of-CSS--AaYBhHD90yG9woSppCLf~j7XAg-ml1WvA6P7hSbkzeOM1Yhm%23:uid=009958966160135303539075&amp;h2=Sizing-and-scaling">sizing and scaling functions</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>rect()</code></h4>



<p>This function was part of the deprecated <code>clip</code> property. Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path">the <code>clip-path</code> property</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path%23Values">its values</a> instead.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>target-counter()</code>, <code>target-counters()</code>, and <code>target-text()</code></h4>



<p>These functions were intended to help work with fragment URLs for paged (printed) media. You can read more about them on the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/">CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module</a> documentation</p>
</div></div>



<h4>Typography</h4>



<p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period">The web is typography</a>, so it makes sense to give your type the care and attention it deserves. While CSS provides some functions specifically designed to unlock the potential of your website or webapp’s chosen typefaces, it is advised to <strong>not</strong> use the following functions to access these advanced features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings">use lower-level syntax via font-feature-settings</a>. You can figure out if the font you’re using supports these features by using a &nbsp;<a href="https://wakamaifondue.com/">tool such as Wakamai Fondue</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>character-variant()</code>, <code>styleset()</code>, and <code>stylistic()</code></h4>



<p>Many typefaces made by professional foundries include alternate treatments for certain letters, or combinations of letters. One example use case is providing different variations of commonly-used letters for typefaces designed to look like handwriting, to help make it appear more natural-looking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cvNTsEkr.png?fit=1024%2C228&amp;ssl=1" alt="Two examples of the sentence, “Easy Sunday morning &amp; my fox.

<p>Utilizing these functions activates these special alternate characters, provided they are present in the font’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_glyph_set">glyph set</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not a standardized offering. Different typefaces will have different ranges of support, based on what the typographer chose to include. It would be wise to check to see if the font you’re using supports these special features before writing any code.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>format()</code></h4>



<p>When you are <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/">importing a font</a> via the <code>url()</code> function, the <code>format()</code> function is an optional hint that lets you manually specify the font’s file format. If this hint is provided, the browser won’t download the font if it does not recognize the specified file format.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src: url('mywebfont.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Cutting edge browsers */
       url('mywebfont.woff') format('woff'), /* Most modern Browsers */
       url('mywebfont.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Older Safari, Android, iOS */
}</code></pre>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>leader()</code></h4>



<p>You know when you’re reading a menu at a restaurant and there’s a series of periods that help you figure out what price is attached to what menu item? Those are leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The W3C had plans for them with its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/%23leaders">CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module</a>, but it unfortunately seems like <code>leader()</code> never quite managed to take off. Fortunately, the W3C also provides an example of how to accomplish this effect <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/leaders.en.html">using a clever application of the <code>content</code> property</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>local()</code></h4>



<p><code>local()</code> allows you to specify a font installed locally, meaning it is present on the device. Local fonts either ship with the device, or can be manually installed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betting on someone installing a font so things look the way you want them to is very risky! Because of this, it is recommended you don’t specify a local font that needs to be manually installed. Your site won’t look the way it is intended to, even moreso if you don’t <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-fallback-font-stacks-robust-web-typography/">specify a fallback font</a>.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@font-face {
  font-family: 'FeltTipPen';
  src: local('Felt Tip Pen Web'), /* Full font name */
       local('FeltTipPen-Regular'); /* Postscript name */
}</code></pre>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>ornaments()</code></h4>



<p>Special <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat">dingbat characters</a> can be enabled using this function. Be careful, as not all dingbat characters are properly coded in a way that will work well if a user does something like change the font, or use a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reader-mode-the-button-to-beat/">specialized browsing mode</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h4><code>swash()</code></h4>



<p>Swashes are alternate visual treatments for letters that give them an extra-fancy flourish. They’re commonly found in italic and cursive-style typefaces.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FC2d_nLh.png?fit=1024%2C368&amp;ssl=1" alt="An example of a swash being applied to a script-style typeface.

<h3>Why so many?</h3>



<p>CSS is maligned as frequently as it is misunderstood. The guiding thought to understanding why all these functions are made available to us is knowing that CSS isn’t prescriptive — not every website has to look like a Microsoft Word document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technologies that power the web are designed in such a way that someone with enough interest can build whatever they want. It’s a powerful, revolutionary concept, a large part of why the web became so ubiquitous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Favicons are the little icons you see in your browser tab. They help you understand which site is which when you’re scanning through your browser’s bookmarks and open tabs. They’re a neat part of internet history that are capable of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/different-favicon-for-development/">performing some cool tricks</a>.</p>



<p>One very new trick is the ability to use SVG as a favicon. It’s something that <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-svg">most modern browsers support</a>, with more support on the way.</p>



<span id="more-306644"></span>



<p>Here’s the code for how to add favicons to your site:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg">
&lt;link rel="alternate icon" href="/favicon.ico">
&lt;link rel="mask-icon" href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#ff8a01"></code></pre>



<p>If a browser doesn’t support a SVG favicon, it will ignore the first link element declaration and continue on to the second. This ensures that all browsers that support favicons can enjoy the experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may also notice the alternate attribute value for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel">our <code>rel</code> declaration</a> in the second line. This programmatically communicates to the browser that the favicon with a file format that uses <code>.ico</code> is specifically used as an alternate presentation.</p>



<p>Following the favicons is a line of code that loads another SVG image, one called <code>safari-pinned-tab.svg</code>. This is to support <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/pinnedTabs/pinnedTabs.html">Safari’s pinned tab functionality</a>, which existed before other browsers had SVG favicon support. There’s additional files you can add here to enhance your site for different apps and services, but more on that in a bit.</p>

<h3>Why SVG?</h3>



<p>You may be questioning why this is needed. The <code>.ico</code> file format has been around forever and can support images up to 256×256 pixels in size. Here are three answers for you.</p>



<h4>Ease of authoring</h4>



<p>It’s a pain to make <code>.ico</code> files. The file is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)">proprietary format</a> used by Microsoft, meaning you’ll need <a href="https://www.kodlian.com/apps/icon-slate">specialized tools</a> to make them. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/">SVG is an open standard</a>, meaning you can use them without any further tooling or platform lock-in.</p>



<h4>Future-proofing</h4>



<p>Retina? 5k? 6k? When we use a resolution-agnostic SVG file for a favicon, we guarantee that our favicons look crisp on future devices, regardless of <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">how large their displays get</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>SVGs are usually very small files, especially when compared to their raster image counterparts — even more-so if you <a href="https://css-tricks.com/tools-for-optimizing-svg/">optimize them beforehand</a>. By only using a 16×16 pixel favicon as a fallback for browsers that don’t support SVG, we provide a combination that enjoys a high degree of support with a smaller file size to boot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This might seem a bit extreme, but when it comes to web performance, every byte counts!</p>



<h3>Tricks</h3>



<p>Another cool thing about SVG is we can <a href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-properties-and-css/">embed CSS directly in it</a>. This means we can do fun things like dynamically adjust them with JavaScript, provided the SVG is declared inline and not embedded using an <code>img</code> element.</p>



<pre rel="SVG" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-svg" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;svg  version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  &lt;style>
    path { fill: #272019; }
  &lt;/style>
  &lt;!-- etc. -->
&lt;/svg></code></pre>



<p>Since SVG favicons are embedded using the <code>link</code> element, they can’t really be modified using JavaScript. We can, however, use things like emoji and media queries.</p>



<h4>Emoji</h4>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/leaverou/">Lea Verou</a> had a genius idea about using emoji inside of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/text">SVG’s <code>text</code> element</a> to make a quick favicon with a transparent background that holds up at small sizes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1241619866475474946
</div></figure>



<p>In response, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/emojis-as-favicons/">Chris Coyier whipped up a neat little demo</a> that lets you play around with the concept.</p>



<h4>Dark Mode support</h4>



<p>Both <a href="https://blog.tomayac.com/2019/09/21/prefers-color-scheme-in-svg-favicons-for-dark-mode-icons/">Thomas Steiner</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=294179#c72">Mathias Bynens</a> independently stumbled across the idea that you can use the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query to provide support for dark mode. This work is built off of <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2016/svg-media-queries/">Jake Archibald’s exploration of SVG and media queries</a>.</p>



<pre rel="SVG" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-svg" data-line="4-6"><code markup="tt">&lt;svg width="128" height="128" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  &lt;style>
    path { fill: #000000; }
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      path { fill: #ffffff; }
    }
  &lt;/style>
  &lt;path d="M111.904 52.937a1.95 1.95 0 00-1.555-1.314l-30.835-4.502-13.786-28.136c-.653-1.313-2.803-1.313-3.456 0L48.486 47.121l-30.835 4.502a1.95 1.95 0 00-1.555 1.314 1.952 1.952 0 00.48 1.99l22.33 21.894-5.28 30.918c-.115.715.173 1.45.768 1.894a1.904 1.904 0 002.016.135L64 95.178l27.59 14.59c.269.155.576.232.883.232a1.98 1.98 0 001.133-.367 1.974 1.974 0 00.768-1.894l-5.28-30.918 22.33-21.893c.518-.522.71-1.276.48-1.99z" fill-rule="nonzero"/>
&lt;/svg></code></pre>



<p>For supporting browsers, this code means our star-shaped SVG favicon will change its fill color from black to white when <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">dark mode</a> is activated. Pretty neat!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dark-mode-favicon-switch.mov"></video></figure>



<h4>Other media queries</h4>



<p>Dark mode support got me thinking: if SVGs can support <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>, what other things can we do with them? While the support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/">Level 5 Media Queries</a> may not be there yet, here’s some ideas to consider:</p>



<ul><li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#light-level"><code>light-level</code></a> to desaturate favicon colors in a low-light environment.</li><li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#inverted"><code>inverted-colors</code></a> to “flip” inverted colors to preserve branding, or to ensure a photorealistic favicon looks as intended.</li><li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-reduced-motion"><code>prefers-reduced-motion</code></a> to remove <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-making-of-an-animated-favicon/">favicon animation</a>. Ideally, we&#8217;d <a href="https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-prefers-reduced-motion-the-reduced-motion-media-query/">avoid animating favicons in the first place</a>, as they can be a trigger for ADHD and other related disabilities.</li><li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#forced-colors"><code>forced-colors</code></a> and/or a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs-high-contrast-mode/">Windows High Contrast Mode media query</a> to make sure the favicon holds up visually in a high contrast color context. Remember to <a href="https://www.gwhitworth.com/blog/2017/04/how-to-use-ms-high-contrast/">use color keywords</a> to keep the favicon’s colors dynamic!</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EeH-tuAJ.png?fit=1024%2C427&amp;ssl=1" alt="Mockup of four SVG favicon treatments.

<h3>Keep it crisp</h3>



<p>Another important aspect of good favicon design is making sure they look good in the small browser tab area. The secret to this is making the paths of the vector image <a href="https://icons8.com/articles/make-pixel-perfect-icons/">line up to the pixel grid</a>, the guide a computer uses to turn SVG math into the bitmap we see on a screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a simplified example using a square shape:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1BTkjpFp.png?ssl=1" alt="A crisp orange square on a white background. There is also a faint grid of gray horizontal and vertical lines that represent the pixel grid. Screenshot from Figma." class="wp-image-306649" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1BTkjpFp.png?w=895&amp;ssl=1 895w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1BTkjpFp.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1BTkjpFp.png?resize=768%2C658&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>When the vector points of the square align to the pixel grid of the artboard, the antialiasing effect a computer uses to smooth out the shapes isn&#8217;t needed. When the vector points aren’t aligned, we get a “smearing” effect:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YIpL6HtQ.png?ssl=1" alt="A blurred orange square on a white background. There is also a faint grid of gray horizontal and vertical lines that represent the pixel grid. Screenshot from Figma." class="wp-image-306650" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YIpL6HtQ.png?w=895&amp;ssl=1 895w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YIpL6HtQ.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YIpL6HtQ.png?resize=768%2C658&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>A vector point’s position can be adjusted on the pixel grid by using a vector editing program such as <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a>. These programs export SVGs as well. To adjust a vector point’s location, select each node with a precision selection tool and drag it into position.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vector-cleanup.mov"></video></figure>



<p>Some more complicated icons may need to be simplified, in order to look good at such a small size. If you’re looking for a good primer on this, <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/responsive-logos-part-1-tips-for-adapting-logos-for-small-screens/">Jeremy Frank wrote a really good two-part article over at Vidget</a>.</p>



<h3>Go the extra mile</h3>



<p>In addition to favicons, there are a bunch of different (and unfortunately proprietary) ways to use icons to enhance its experience. These include things like the aforementioned pinned tab icon for Safari<a href="#fn:1">¹</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254">chat app unfurls</a>, a <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-add-windows-tiles-to-your-website--cms-23099">pinned Windows start menu tile</a>, social media previews, and homescreen launchers.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a great place to get started with these kinds of enhancements, I really like <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/">realfavicongenerator.net</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vzCkODbQ.png?ssl=1" alt="Icon output from realfavicongenerator.net arranged in a grid using CSS-Trick’s logo.

<p>A funny thing about the history of the favicon: Internet Explorer was the first browser to support them and <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/how-we-got-the-favicon/">they were snuck in at the 11th hour</a> by a developer named Bharat Shyam:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As the story goes, late one night, Shyam was working on his new favicon feature. He called over junior project manager Ray Sun to take a look.</p><p>Shyam commented, “This is good, right? Check it in?”, requesting permission to check the code into the Internet Explorer codebase so it could be released in the next version. Sun didn’t think too much of it, the feature was cool and would clearly give IE an edge. So he told Shyam to go ahead and add it. And just like that, the favicon made its way into Internet Explorer 5, which would go on to become one of the largest browser releases the web has ever seen.</p><p>The next day, Sun was reprimanded by his manager for letting the feature get by so quickly. As it turns out, Shyam had specifically waited until later in the day, knowing that a less experienced Program Manager would give him a pass. But by then, the code had been merged in. Incidentally, you’d be surprised just how many relatively major browser features have snuck their way into releases like this.</p><cite>From <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/how-we-got-the-favicon/">How We Got the Favicon</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jay_hoffmann">Jay Hoffmann</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I’m happy to see the platform throw a little love at favicons. They’ve long been one of my favorite little design details, and I’m excited that they’re becoming more reactive to user’s needs. If you have a moment, why not sneak a SVG favicon into your project the same way Bharat Shyam did way back in 1999.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a pessimist is an easy thing to fall back on, and I’m trying to be better about it. As we close the year out, I thought it would be a good exercise to take stock of the state of the web and count our blessings.</p>
<p><span id="more-298289"></span></p>
<h3>Versatile</h3>
<p>We don&#8217;t use the internet to do just one thing. With more than two decades of globally interconnected computers, the web allows us to use it for all manner of activity.</p>
<p>This includes platforms, processes, and products that existed before the web came into being, and also previously unimagined concepts and behaviors. Thanks to the web, we can all order takeout the same way we can all <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/18/771224479/2-american-women-astronauts-venture-out-for-first-all-female-spacewalk">watch two women repair a space station in realtime</a>.</p>
<h3>Decentralized</h3>
<p>There is still no one single arbiter you need to petition to sign off on the validity of your idea, or one accepted path for going about to make it happen. Any website can link out to, or be linked to, without having to <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/05/31/tell-the-eu-dont-put-price.html">pay a tax</a> or file pre-approval paperwork.</p>
<p>While we have seen a consolidation of the services needed to run more sophisticated web apps, you can still put your ideas out for the entire world to see with nothing more than a static HTML page. This fact was, and still is, historically unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Resilient</h3>
<p>The internet has been called the most hostile environment to develop for. Someone who works on the web has to consider multiple browsers, the operating systems they are installed on, and all the popular release versions of both. They also need to consider screen size and quality, variable network conditions, different form factors and input modes, third party scripts, etc. This is to say nothing about serving an unknown amount of unknown users, each with their own thoughts, feelings, goals, abilities, motivations, proficiencies, and device modifications.</p>
<p>If you do it right, you can <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">build a website or a web app so that it can survive a lot of damage</a> before it is rendered completely inoperable. Frankly, the fact that the web works at all is nothing short of miraculous.</p>
<p>The failsafes, guardrails, redundancies, and other considerations built into the platform from the packet level on up allow this to happen. Honoring them honors the thought, care, and planning that went into <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/">the web&#8217;s foundational principles</a>.</p>
<h3>Responsive</h3>
<p>Most websites now make use of media queries to ensure their content reads and works well across a staggeringly large amount of devices. This efficient technology choice is fault-tolerant, has a low barrier of entry, and neatly side-steps <a href="https://fberriman.com/2019/10/07/the-term-responsive-web-design-has-failed/">the</a> <a href="https://fberriman.com/2019/10/07/the-term-responsive-web-design-has-failed/">myriad</a> <a href="https://fberriman.com/2019/10/07/the-term-responsive-web-design-has-failed/">problems</a> you get with approaches such as device-sniffing and/or conditionally serving massive piles of JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Design</a> was, and still is revolutionary. It was the right answer, at the right place and time. It elegantly handled the compounding problem of viewport fragmentation as the web transformed from something new and novel into something that is woven into our everyday lives.</p>
<h3>Adaptable</h3>
<p>In addition to being responsive, the web works across a huge range of form factors, device capabilities, and specialized browsing modes. The post you are currently reading can show up on a laptop, a phone, a Kindle, a TV, a gas station pump, a video game console, a refrigerator, a car, a billboard, an oscilloscope—heck, even a space shuttle (if you’re reading this from space, please, please, <em>please</em> let me know).</p>
<p>It will work with a <a href="https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/building-websites-for-safari-reader-mode-and-other-reading-apps-1562913c86c9">reading mode</a> that helps a person focus, dark and high contrast modes that will help a person see, and any number of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spreed-speed-read-the-web/ipikiaejjblmdopojhpejjmbedhlibno?hl=en-US">specialized browser extensions</a> that help people get what they need. I have a friend who inverts her entire display to help prevent triggering migraines, and the web just rolls with it. How great is that?</p>
<p>Web content can be read, translated, spoken aloud, copied, clipped, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">piped into your terminal</a>, forked, remixed, scraped by a robot, <a href="https://www.afb.org/node/16207/refreshable-braille-displays">output as Braille</a>, and even <a href="https://typatone.com/">played as music</a>. You can increase the size of its text, change its font and color, and block parts you don&#8217;t want to deal with—all in the service of making it easier for you to consume. That is revolutionary when compared to the media that came before it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, thanks to things like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">Progressive Web Apps</a> and <a href="https://whatwebcando.today/">Web Platform Features</a>, the web now blends seamlessly into desktops and home screens. These features allow web content to behave like traditional apps and are treated as first-class citizens by the operating systems that support them. <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/offline-first/">You don’t even necessarily need to be online</a> for them to work!</p>
<h3>Accessible</h3>
<p>The current landscape of accessibility compliance is a depressing state of affairs. <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM’s Million report</a>, and <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/update">subsequent update</a>, highlights this with a sobering level of detail.</p>
<p>Out of the top one million websites sampled, ~98% of home pages had programmatically detectable <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG)</a> errors. This represents a complete, categorical failure of our industry on every conceivable level, from developers and designers, to <a href="https://blog.pope.tech/2018/10/25/angular-accessibility-and-you/">framework maintainers</a>, all the way up to <a href="https://github.com/WICG/portals/issues/112">those who help steer the future of the platform</a>.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>In that last stubborn two percent lives <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#context">a promise of the web</a>. Web accessibility—the ability for someone to use a website or web app regardless of their ability or circumstance—grants autonomy. It represents a rare space where a disabled individual may operate free from the immense amount of <a href="https://www.lflegal.com/2019/10/dominos-comments/">bias, misunderstanding, and outright hate</a> that is pervasive throughout much of society. This autonomy represents not only freedom for social activities but also <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_S1811&amp;prodType=table">employment opportunities</a> for a population that is routinely discriminated against.</p>
<p>There is a ton of work to do, and we do not have the luxury of defeatism. I’m actually optimistic about digital accessibility’s future. Things like <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mismatch">Inclusive Design</a> have shifted the conversation away from remediation into <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect">a more holistic, proactive approach</a> to product design.</p>
<p>Accessibility, long viewed as an unglamorous topic, has started to appear as a mainstream, top-level theme in conference and workshop circuits, as well as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/tag/accessibility/">popular industry blogs</a>. Sophisticated <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">automated accessibility checkers</a> can help prevent you from shipping inaccessible code. Design systems are helping to <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/inclusive-design/">normalize the practice at scale</a>. And most importantly, accessibility practitioners are <a href="https://conf.a11yto.com/talks#Accessibility-Is-A-Hydra">speaking openly about ableism</a>.</p>
<h3>Inexpensive</h3>
<p>While <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web?start=earliest&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list#bytesTotal">the average size of a website continues to rise</a>, the fact remains that you can achieve an incredible amount of functionality with a small amount of code. That’s an important thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p>It has never been more affordable to use the web. In the United States, you can <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/prepaid-phones/all-prepaid-phones/1105910_4527935_1072335_8991975?cat_id=1105910_4527935_1072335_8991975&amp;facet=price%3A%240+-+%2450">buy an internet-ready smartphone for ~$40</a>. Emerging markets are adopting feature phones such as the JioPhone (~$15 USD) at an incredible rate. This means that access to the world’s information is available to more people—people who traditionally may have never been able to have such a privilege.</p>
<p>Think about it: owning a desktop computer represented having enough steady income to be able to support permanent housing, as well as consistent power and phone service. This created an implicit barrier to entry during the web’s infancy.</p>
<p>The weakening of this barrier opens up unimaginable amounts of opportunity, and is an excellent reminder that <a href="https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/228960085672599552">the web really is for everyone</a>. With that in mind, it remains vital to <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">keep our payload sizes down</a>. What might be a reflexive <code>CMD</code> + <code>R</code> for you might be <a href="https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-30-2019-performance/">an entire week’s worth of data</a> for someone else.</p>
<h3>Diverse</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers">more browsers availabl</a><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers">e</a> than I have fingers and toes to count on. This is a good thing. Like any other category of software, each browser is an app that does the same general thing in the same general way, but with specific design decisions made to prioritize different needs and goals.</p>
<p>My favorite browser, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, puts a lot of its attention towards maintaining the privacy and security of its users. Both <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Edge</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> are bundled with their respective operating systems, and have interfaces geared towards helping the widest range of users browse web content. Browsers like <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a> are geared towards tinkerers, people who like a highly customized browsing experience. <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-internet/">Samsung Internet</a> is an alternative browser for Android devices that can integrate with their proprietary hardware. <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> and <a href="https://www.ucweb.com/">UC</a> browsers provide access to millions of feature phones, helping them to have smartphone-esque functionality. Chrome helps you <s>receive more personalized ads</s> efficiently debug JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/">Browser engine diversity is important</a> as well, although the ecosystem has been getting disturbingly small as of late. The healthy competition multiple engines generates translates directly to the experience becoming better for the most important people in the room: Those who rely on the web to live their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Speaking of people, let’s discuss the web’s quality of diversity and how it applies to them: Our industry, like many others, has historically been plagued by ills such as misogyny, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and classism. However, the fact remains that the ability to solve problems in the digital space represents a rare form of leverage that allows minoritized groups to have <a href="http://www.resilientcoders.org/">upward economic mobility</a>.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t be motivated by human decency, it’s no secret that <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-other-diversity-dividend">more diverse teams perform better</a>. We’ve made good strides in the past few years towards better representation, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/codewithveni/">Listen to, and signal boost</a> the triumphs, frustrations, and fears of the underrepresented in our industry. Internalize their observations and challenge your preconceived notions and biases. Advocate for their right to be in this space. Educate yourself on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/02/19/women-built-tech-industry-then-they-were-pushed-out/">our industry’s history</a>. Support things like codes of conduct, which do the hard work of modeling and codifying expectations for behavior. All of this helps to push against a toxic status quo and makes the industry better for everyone.</p>
<h3>Standardized</h3>
<p>The web is built by consensus, enabling a radical kind of functionality. This interoperability—the ability for different computer systems to be able to exchange information—is built from <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">a set of standards we have all collectively agreed on</a>.</p>
<p>Chances are good that a web document written two decades ago will still work with the latest version of any major browser. Any web document written by someone else—even someone on the opposite side of the globe—will also work. It will also <a href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2019-10-21-using-the-platform/">continue to work</a> on browsers and devices that have yet to be invented. I challenge you to name another file format that supports this level of functionality that has an equivalent lifespan.</p>
<p>This futureproofing by way of standardization also allows for a solid foundation of support for whatever comes next. Remember the principle of versatile: It is important to remember that these standards are also not prescriptive. We’re free to take these building blocks use arrange them in a near-infinite number of ways.</p>
<h3>Open</h3>
<p>Furthermore, this consensus is transparent. While the process may seem slow sometimes, it is worth highlighting the fact that the process is highly transparent. Anyone who is invested <a href="https://github.com/w3c">may follow, and contribute to web standards</a>, warts and all.</p>
<p>It’s this openness that helps to prevent things like hidden agendas, privatization, lock-in, and <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/05/a-report-from-the-amp-advisory-committee-meeting/">disproportionate influence from consolidating power</a>. Open-source software and protocols and, most importantly, large-scale cooperation also sustain the web platform’s long-term growth and health. Think of web technologies that didn’t make it: Flash, Silverlight, ActiveX, etc. All closed, for-profit, brittle, and private.</p>
<p>It also helps to disincentive more abstract threats, things like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">adversarial interoperability</a> and failure to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/a-vulnerability-in-adobe-flash-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution-apsb19-26_2019-054/">disclose vulnerabilities</a>. These kinds of hazards are a good thing to remember any time you find yourself frustrated with the platform.</p>
<hr />
<p>Make no mistake: I feel a lot of what makes the web great is actively being dismantled, either inadvertently or deliberately. But as I mentioned earlier, cynicism is easy. My wish for next year? That all the qualities mentioned here are still present. My New Year’s resolution? To help ensure it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/)">I wrote about <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code></a>, a media query introduced into Safari 10.1 to help people with <a href="https://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/types-vestibular-disorders">vestibular</a> and seizure disorders use the web. The article provided some background about the media query, why it was needed, and how to work with it to avoid creating disability-triggering visual effects. </p>
<p>The article was informed by other people’s excellent work, namely <a href="https://twitter.com/decadecity">Orde Saunders</a>’ post about <a href="https://decadecity.net/blog/2015/06/28/user-queries">user queries</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/vlh">Val Head</a>’s article on <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/">web animation motion sensitivity</a>. </p>
<p>We’re now four months into 2019, and it makes me happy to report that we have support for the feature in all major desktop browsers! Safari was first, with Firefox being a close second. Chrome was a little late to the party, but introduced it as of version 74.</p>
<p><div class="caniuse"><div class="caniuse-header"><p>This browser support data is from <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-reduced-motion">Caniuse</a>, which has more detail. A number indicates that browser supports the feature at that version and up.</p></div><div class="caniuse-section"><h4>Desktop</h4><table class="browser-support-table"><thead><tr><th class="chrome"><span>Chrome</span></th><th class="firefox"><span>Firefox</span></th><th class="ie"><span>IE</span></th><th class="edge"><span>Edge</span></th><th class="safari"><span>Safari</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="y yep" title="Chrome - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">74</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Firefox - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">63</span></td><td class="n nope" title="IE - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">No</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Edge - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">79</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Safari - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">10.1</span></td></tr></table></div><div class="caniuse-section"><h4>Mobile / Tablet</h4><table class="browser-support-table"><thead><tr><th class="and_chr"><span>Android Chrome</span></th><th class="and_ff"><span>Android Firefox</span></th><th class="android"><span>Android</span></th><th class="ios_saf"><span>iOS Safari</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="y yep" title="Android Chrome - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">81</span></td><td class="n nope" title="Android Firefox - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">No</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Android - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">81</span></td><td class="y yep" title="iOS Safari - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">10.3</span></td></tr></table></div></div></p>
<p>While Microsoft Edge does not have support for <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>, it will <a href="https://css-tricks.com/edge-goes-chromium-what-does-it-mean-for-front-end-developers/">become Chrome under the hood</a> soon. If there’s one good thing to come from this situation, it’s that <a href="https://twitter.com/gregwhitworth/status/1100515214355648513">Edge’s other excellent accessibility features</a> will (hopefully) have a good chance of being back-ported into Chrome.</p>
<p><span id="more-286790"></span></p>
<h3>Awareness</h3>
<p>While I’m happy to see some websites and web apps using the media query, I find that it’s rare to encounter it outside of places maintained by people who are active in CSS and accessibility spaces. In a way, this makes sense. While <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> is relatively new, CSS features and functionality as a whole are often <a href="http://www.heydonworks.com/article/reluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack">overlooked and undervalued</a>. <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">Accessibility even more so</a>. </p>
<p>It’s tough to blame someone for not using a feature they don’t know exists, especially if it’s relatively new, and especially in an industry as fast-paced as ours. The deck is also stacked in terms of what the industry prioritizes as marketable, and therefore what developers pay attention to. And yet, <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> is a library-agnostic feature that ties into Operating System-level functionality. I’m pretty sure that means it’ll have some significant staying power in terms of reward for time spent for skill acquisition.</p>
<p>Speaking of rewards, I think it’s also worth pointing out the true value <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> represents: Not attracting buzzword-hungry recruiters on LinkedIn, but improving the quality of life for the people who benefit from the effect it creates. Using this media query could spare someone from having to unnecessarily endure a tremendous amount of pain for simply having the curiosity to click on a link or scroll down a page. </p>
<h3>The people affected</h3>
<p>When it comes to disability, many people just assume “blind people.” The reality is that disabilities are a complicated and nuanced topic, one that is surprisingly pervasive, deeply personal, and full of <a href="https://twitter.com/codingchaos/status/1121175191847985153">unfortunate misconceptions</a>. It&#8217;s also highly variable. Different people are affected by different disability conditions in different ways &mdash; extending to a wide gamut of permanent, temporary, environmental, and situational concerns. Multiple, compounding conditions can (and do) affect individuals, and sometimes what helps one person might hinder another. It’s a difficult, but very vital thing to keep in mind. </p>
<p>If you have a vestibular disorder or have certain kinds of migraine or seizure triggers, <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/motion-sick/">navigating the web can be a lot like walking through a minefield</a> &mdash; you’re perpetually one click away from activating an unannounced animation. And that’s just for casual browsing. </p>
<p>If you use the web for work, you might have no choice but to endure a web app that contains triggering animations multiple times a week, or even per day or hour. In addition to not having the autonomy to modify your work device, you may also not have the option to quickly and easily change jobs &mdash; a privilege easily forgotten when you’re <a href="http://theengineeringmanager.com/growth/job-hopping-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">a specialized knowledge worker</a>. </p>
<p>It’s a fallacy to assume that a person is aware of their vestibular disorder, or what triggers it. In fact, sometimes the initial triggering experience exacerbates your sensitivity and makes other parts of a design difficult to use. <a href="https://twitter.com/fcorradini">Facundo Corradini</a> shares his experience with this phenomenon in his article, <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/accessibility-for-vestibular/">“Accessibility for Vestibular Disorders: How My Temporary Disability Changed My Perspective.”</a></p>
<p><a href"https://medium.com/@kaylajheffernan/facilitation-tips-for-research-with-blind-users-acf7dad6554b">Not all assistive technology users are power users</a>, so it’s another fallacy to assume that a person with a vestibular disorder is aware of, or has the <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_h_lauke/status/1105247881571852293">access rights</a> to enable a motion-reducing Operating System setting or <a href="https://togglific.io/">install a browser extension</a>. </p>
<p>Think of someone working in a large corporation who has to use a provisioned computer with locked-down capabilities. Or someone who isn’t fully aware of what of their tablet is capable of doing past browsing social media, watching video, and messaging their family and friends. Or a cheap and/or unorthodox device that will never support <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> feature &mdash; some people purchase discontinued devices such as the Windows Phone specifically because their deprecation makes them affordable.</p>
<p>Do these people deserve to be hurt because of their circumstances? Of course not.</p>
<h3>Considering what’s harmful</h3>
<p>You can tie harm into value, the same way you can with delight. Animation intended to nudge a person towards a signup could also drive them away. This kind of exit metric is more <a href="https://twitter.com/karlgroves/status/1071482532762394624">difficult to quantify</a>, but it definitely happens. Sometimes the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/22/tweet-that-sent-journalist-kurt-eichenwald-into-seizure-considered-deadly-weapon-in-indictment/?utm_term=.b0fec737f8a6">harm is even intentional</a>, and therefore an easier datapoint to capture &mdash; what you <a href="https://twitter.com/thelionmachine/status/1101958611549519873">do with that information</a> is a whole other issue.</p>
<p>If enough harm happens to enough people, it affects that certain something we know as branding. This effect doesn’t even need to be tied to a disability condition. Too much animation, applied to the wrong things in the wrong way will drive people away, even if they can’t precisely articulate <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>You also don’t know who might be on the receiving end, or what circumstances they’re experiencing the moment they load your website or web app. We can’t &mdash; <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-events/">and shouldn’t</a> &mdash; know this kind of information, either. It could be a prospective customer, the employee at a venture capitalist firm tasked with evaluating your startup, or maybe even your new boss.</p>
<p>We also don’t need to qualify their relationship to us to determine if their situation is worth considering &mdash; <strong>isn’t it enough to just be proactively kind?</strong></p>
<h3>Animation is progressive enhancement</h3>
<p>We also need to acknowledge that <a href="https://css-tricks.com/mobile-small-portrait-slow-interlace-monochrome-coarse-non-hover-first/">not every device that can access the web can also render animation, or render animation smoothly</a>. When animation is used on a low-power or low quality device that “technically” supports it, the overall user experience suffers. Some people even <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/accessibility-and-low-powered-devices/">deliberately seek this experience out</a> as a feature.</p>
<p>Devices may also be set to specialized browsing modes to allow people to access your content in alternate ways. This concept is known as being <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/pour/robust">robust</a>, and is one of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head">the four high-level principles</a> that govern <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">the guidelines outlining how to craft accessible experiences</a>. </p>
<p>Animation might not always look the way you intend it in these modes. One example would be when the viewport is zoomed and the animation isn’t built using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Relative_length_units">relative units</a>. There’s a non-trivial chance important parts might be pushed out of the viewport, leaving the animation appearing as a random collection of flickering bits. Another example of a specialized browsing mode might be <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reader-mode-the-button-to-beat/">Reader Mode</a>, where the animation may not appear at all.</p>
<h3>Taking it to code</h3>
<p>Considering all this, I’m wondering if there are opportunities to help web professionals become more aware of, and therefore more considerate of the downsides of poorly conceived and implemented animation. </p>
<p>Maybe we proactively incorporate a media query high up in the cascade to disable all animation for those who desire it, and for those who have devices that can’t support it. This can be accomplished by targeting anything where someone has expressed a desire for a low-to-no-animation experience, or any device that has a slow screen refresh rate. </p>
<p>The first part of the query, targeting low-to-no-animation, is done via <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. The second, targeting a screen with a low refresh rate, uses <code>update</code>. <code>update</code> is a new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Targeting_media_features">media feature</a> that allows us to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#update">“query the ability of the output device to modify the appearance of content once it has been rendered.”</a></p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">@media screen and
  (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce), 
  (update: slow) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.001ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important; /* Hat tip Nick/cssremedy (https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-prefers-reduced-motion-the-reduced-motion-media-query/#comment-1700170) */
    transition-duration: 0.001ms !important;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This code forces all animation that utilizes a declaration of <code>animation-duration</code> or <code>transition-duration</code> to conclude at a rate that is imperceptible to the human eye. It will work when a person has requested a reduced motion experience, or the device has a screen with a slow refresh rate, say e-ink or a cheap smartphone. </p>
<p>Retaining the animation and transition duration also ensures that any functionality that is tied to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/animations/css-vs-javascript">CSS-based animation</a> will activate successfully (unlike using a declaration of <code>animation: none</code>), while still preventing a disability condition trigger or creating rendering lag.</p>
<p>This declaration is authored with the intent of introducing some intentional friction into our <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/">reset styles</a>. Granted, it’s not a perfect solution, but it does drive at a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increasing the chances of developers becoming aware of the two media features, by way of making them present in the cascade of every inspected element.</li>
<li>Providing a moment to consider why and how animation will be introduced into a website or web app, and what the experience should be like for those who can’t or don’t want to experience it.</li>
<li>Encouraging developers who are less familiar with CSS to think of the cascade in terms of components and nudge them towards making more easily maintainable stylesheets.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Animation isn’t unnecessary</h3>
<p>In addition to vestibular disorders and photosensitive conditions, there’s another important aspect of accessibility we must consider: <strong>cognitive disabilities.</strong></p>
<h4>Cognitive disabilities</h4>
<p>As a concern, <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/">the category is wide and often difficult to quantify</a>, but no less important than <a href="https://webaim.org/intro/#people">any other accessibility discipline</a>. It is also far more prevalent. To expand on this some, the World Health Organization reports <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders">an estimated 300 million people worldwide are affected by depression</a>, a temporary or permanent, environmental and/or biological condition that can significantly impair your ability to interact with your environment. This includes interfering with your ability to understand the world around you.</p>
<p>Animation can be a great tool to help combat some forms of cognitive disability by using it to break down complicated concepts, or communicate the relationship between seemingly disparate objects. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/#section6">Val Head’s article on <em>A List Apart</em></a> highlights some other <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/#section6">very well-researched benefits</a>, including helping to increase problem-solving ability, recall, and skill acquisition, as well as reducing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">cognitive load</a> and your susceptibility to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness">change blindness</a>.</p>
<h4>Reduce isn’t necessarily remove</h4>
<p>We may not need to throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to using animation. Remember, it’s <code>prefers-<em>reduced</em>-motion</code>, not <code>prefers-no-motion</code>.</p>
<p>If we embrace the cascade, we can work with the animation reset code described earlier on a per-component basis. If the meaning of a component is diminished by removing its animation altogether, we could slow down and simplify the component’s animation to the point where the concept can be communicated without potentially being an accessibility trigger.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling clever, you might even be able to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS Custom Properties</a> to help achieve this in an efficient way. If you’re feeling <em>extra</em> clever, you could also use these Custom Properties for a site-wide animation preferences widget. </p>
<p>In the following code sample, we’re defining default properties for our animation and transition durations, then modifying them based on the context they’re declared in:</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">/* Set default durations */
:root {
  --animation-duration: 250ms; 
  --transition-duration: 250ms; 
}

/* Contextually shorten duration length */
@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce), (update: slow) {
  :root {
    --animation-duration: 0.001ms !important; 
    --transition-duration: 0.001ms !important;
  }
}

@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce), (update: slow) {
  /* Remove duration for all unknown animation when a user requests a reduced animation experience */
  * {
    animation-duration: var(--animation-duration);
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: var(--animation-duration);
  }
}

/* Update the duration when animation is critical to understanding and the device can support it */
@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce), (update: fast) {
  .c-educational-concept {
    /* Set a new animation duration scoped to this component */
    --animation-duration: 6000ms !important; 
    ...
    animation-name: educational-concept;
    /* Use the scoped animation duration */
    animation-duration: var(--animation-duration); 
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>However, trying to test the effectiveness of this slowed-down animation puts us in a bit of a pickle: there’s no real magic number we can write a test against. </p>
<p>We need to have a wide representation of people who are susceptible to animation-based disability triggers to sign off on it being safe, which unfortunately involves subjecting them to something that may potentially not be. That’s a <em>huge</em> ask.</p>
<p>A better approach is to ask about what kinds of animation have been triggers for them in the past, then see if what they describe matches what we’ve made. This approach also puts the onus on yourself, and not the person with a disability, to <a href="https://twitter.com/GHMansfield/status/1119622490010136578">do the work to provide accommodation</a>. </p>
<p>If you’re having trouble finding people, ask your friends, family, and coworkers &mdash; I’m sure there’s more people out there than you think. And if you need a good starting point for creating safer animation, I once again urge you to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/#section7">read Val’s article on <em>A List Apart</em></a>.</p>
<h4>Neurodivergence</h4>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack here, and I’m not the most qualified person to talk about it. Here’s what my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ShellELittle">Shell Little</a>, an Accessibility Specialist at Wells Fargo DS4B, has to say about it:</p>
</div>
<div class="neurodivergence-section">
<blockquote><p>Web animation as it relates to Neurodivergence (ND) can be a fantastic tool to guide users to solidify meaning and push understanding. The big issue is the same animation that can assist one group of <abbr title="Neurodivergence">ND</abbr> users can create a barrier for another. As mentioned by Eric, Neurodivergence is a massive group of people with a vast range of abilities and covers a wide variety of cognitive disabilities including but not limited to <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, autism, dyslexia, epilepsy, dyscalculia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dyspraxia, and Tourette syndrome. </p>
<p>When speaking about motion on the web it’s important we think specifically about attention-related disabilities, autism, and sensory processing disorders that are also closely linked to both. These groups of people, who coincidentally includes me, are especially sensitive to motion as it relates to understanding information and interacting with the web as a whole. Animations can easily overwhelm, distract, and frustrate users who are sensitive to motion and from personal experience, it can even do all three at once. </p>
<p>Because so many people are affected by motion and animation on the web the W3C’s <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> have a criterion named <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html">Pause, Stop, Hide</a> that is specifically written to guide content creators on how to best create accessible animations. My main issues with this guideline are, it only applies to animations that last longer than 5 seconds and motion that is deemed essential is exempt from the standard. That means a ton of animations that can create barriers such as distraction, dizziness, and even harm are out there in the wild. </p>
<p>It makes sense, as Eric mentioned, that we can’t get rid of all animation. Techniques such as spinners let users know the page is still working on the task it was given, and micro-interactions help show progression. But depending on someone’s brain, the things that are helpful at lunch can be a barrier later that night. Someone’s preferences and needs shift throughout their day, and that’s the beauty of <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. It has the potential to be what fills the gaps left by Pause, Stop, Hide and allow users to decide when they do or do not want to have motion. That right there is priceless to someone like me.</p>
<p>As someone with an attention-related disability, an interaction I have found to be exceedingly frustrating is autoplay. Many media sharing sites have auto-playing content such as videos, gifs, and ads but because they can be paused, they pass the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> standard. That doesn’t mean they aren’t a huge barrier for me as I can’t read any text around them when they are playing. This causes me to have to pause every single moving item I run into. This not only significantly slows me down, and eats away at <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">my limited spoons</a>, but it also derails my task flow and train of thought. Now, it is true some sites &mdash; such as Twitter and LinkedIn &mdash; have settings to turn autoplay off, but this isn’t true for all sites. This would be a perfect place for <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. </p>
<p>In a world where I would be able to determine when and if I want videos to start playing at me, I would be able to get more done with less cognitive strain. <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> is freedom for me and the millions of people whose brains work like mine. In sum, the absolute best thing we can do for our users who are sensitive to motion is to put a system in place that empowers them to decide when and where animation should be displayed to them. Let the user decide because they will always know their access needs better than we do.</p></blockquote>

<div class="article-content">
<p>Thanks, Shell!</p>
<h3>I don’t hate fun, I just don’t want to hurt people</h3>
<p>On my own time, I’m fortunate enough to be able to enjoy animation. I appreciate the large amounts of time and attention involved with making something come alive on the screen, and I’ve definitely put my fair share of time ooh-ing and aah-ing over <a href="https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=animation&#038;page=1&#038;order=popularity&#038;depth=everything">other people’s amazing work in CodePen</a>. I’ve also watched enough DC Animated Universe to be able to instantly recognize Kevin Conroy’s voice &mdash; if you’re looking for even deeper nerd cred, Masaaki Yuasa is a seriously underrated animator.</p>
<p>However, I try to not overly rely on animation as a web professional. There’s a number of factors as to why: </p>
<ol>
<li>First is simply pushing on awareness of the concerns outlined earlier, as many are unaware they exist. Animation has such a <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2016/06/we-reward-the-wrong-things.html">crowd-pleasing gee-whiz factor</a> to it that it’s often quickly accepted into a product without a second thought.</li>
<li>Second is mitigating risk. Not adhering to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> &mdash; including <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html">provisions for animation</a> &mdash; means your inaccessible website or web app becomes a legal liability. There is now legal precedent for the websites and web apps of <a href="https://aoda.ca/airline-fined-for-separate-disabled-accessible-website/">private companies being sued</a>, so it’s a powerful metric to weigh your choices against.</li>
<li>Third is user experience. With that gee-whiz factor, people tend to forget that being forced to repeatedly view that super-slick animation over and over again will eventually become a tedious chore. There’s a reason why we no longer make <a href="http://www.sharperfx.com/kkmime/index13.htm">90s-style loading screens (<strong>content warning:</strong> high-contrast strobing and flickering</a>, Flash, mimes). If you need a more contemporary example, consider why <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/63402">Netflix lets us skip TV show intros</a>.</li>
<li>Fourth is understanding the lay of the land. While <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> is getting more support, the majority of it is on desktop browsers, and not mobile. We’re not exactly a desktop-first world anymore, especially if you’re in an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/">underserved community</a> or <a href="https://www.pewglobal.org/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/">emerging market</a>. A mobile form factor also may exacerbate vestibular issues. Moving around while using your device means you may lose a fixed reference point, unlike sitting at a desk and staring at a monitor &mdash; this kind of trigger is similar to why some of us can get seasick.</li>
<li>
The fifth factor is a bit of a subset of the fourth. Animation eats device data and battery, and it’s important to remember that <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/">it’s the world wide web, not the wealthy Western web</a>. The person using your service may not have consistent and reliable access to income or power, so you want to get to know your audience before <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">spending their money for them</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The ask</h3>
<p>Not everyone who could benefit from <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> cares about accessibility-related content, so I’d love to see the media query start showing up in the code of more popular sites. The only real way to do this is to spread awareness. Not only of the media query, but more importantly, understanding the nuance involved with using animation responsibly. </p>
<p>CSS-Tricks is a popular website for the frontend industry, and I’m going to take advantage of that. If you feel comfortable sharing, what I would love is to describe what kinds of animation have been problematic for you, in either <a href="#comments">the comments</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwbailey/status/1123199814106324993">on Twitter</a>. </p>
<p>The idea here is we can help build a reference of what kinds of things to be on the lookout for animation-wise. Hopefully, with time and a little luck, we can all help make the web better for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a young nerd, I loved to immerse myself in digital worlds, learning the ins and outs of the rules someone else had created for me (intentionally or not). But the older and crankier I get, the more I find myself losing patience when navigating these &#8220;delightful&#8221; experiences. </p>
<p>This fascination was great for my eventual career as a designer, but unfortunately, it was also like <a href="https://xkcd.com/1015/">teaching someone kerning</a>—once you learn how to quantify a bad user experience, you can’t go back. </p>
<p>These days, I’m an impatient grump who doesn&#8217;t want to take work home. I just want to get in, get what I need, and get out. If there’s any delight I’m experiencing, it’s lost on me because I had such an effortless and annoyance-free time that it simply doesn’t stand out.</p>
<p>One of the features I find myself turning to over and over again is Safari’s Reader Mode. I read a lot of news, and <a href="https://www.davidputney.com/2015/04/ux-from-hell.html">with that comes a lot of bullshit</a>. I now tap the cryptic little icon almost reflexively, confident that I’ll be transported to a land where I can focus on what matters most to me: content.</p>
<p><span id="more-280754"></span></p>
<figure id="post-280755" class="align-left media-280755"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reader-mode.png?ssl=1" alt="An iPhone screenshot highlighting the Reader Mode button located in the top-right corner of the screen." data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<p>Tapping this button transports me to a land free of newsletter signup modals, surveys, pop-ups, pop-unders, flashing ad banners, automatically-playing video, app install prompts, breaking news alerts, passive-aggressive interstitials, and faux notification permission banners. It slices through the undesirable and unnecessary with ease; the Alexander the Great to the Gordian Knot that is poor user interface design. </p>
<p><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">Firefox also offers this reading mode</a>. So does <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/reading-view-in-microsoft-edge-4103664">Edge</a>. I find myself using it more and more on my laptop with every passing day—especially for reading long-form articles, like this piece. I’d be very surprised to see Chrome institute one natively, as Google is ultimately in the advertising business.</p>
<p>I’m not going to talk about how to best craft your content for Reader Mode. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mandy_Kerr">Mandy Michael</a> already covered this in her article, <a href="https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/building-websites-for-safari-reader-mode-and-other-reading-apps-1562913c86c9">Building websites for Safari Reader Mode and other reading apps.</a> She’s great, and it is a must-read piece.</p>
<p>Building with accessible <a href="https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2018/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html/)">HTML standards is not a dead-end skill</a>. Far from it. If you spend the effort to craft your experiences with a mind to semantics from the start, your content will be able to adapt to specialized reading modes, as well as whatever the future holds with little to no additional effort. Today’s Reader Mode could be tomorrow’s <a href="https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Mirror">smart bathroom mirror</a>. </p>
<p>Spending the effort is an important point: Good design isn’t about forcing someone to walk a tightrope across your carefully manicured lawn. Nor is it a puzzle box casually tossed to the user, hoping they’ll unlock it to reveal a hidden treasure. Good design is about doing the hard work to accommodate the different ways people access a solution to an identified problem.</p>
<p>For reading articles, the core problem is turning my ignorance about an issue into understanding (the funding model for this is a whole other complicated concern). The more obstructions you throw in my way to achieve this goal, the more I am inclined to leave and get my understanding elsewhere—all I’ll remember is how poor a time I had while trying to access your content. What is the value of an ad impression if it ultimately leads to that user never returning?</p>
<p>But this isn’t a website about digital media strategy, nor is it one about user conversion. This is a website about CSS and front-end development. What we’re going to discuss is how to keep people like me from hitting that button by relying on <a href="https://notlaura.com/algorithms-of-css-sources/">this nifty programming language</a> the W3C so wisely gave us. Because if you don’t, all that other stuff—your newsletter signup boxes, your comments, your related articles, your engagement—will be cut away.</p>
<h3>Inclusivity</h3>
<p>What you want to do first is cast a wide net. The more people you can proactively accommodate from the outset, the more people you don’t unintentionally alienate. Our design choices should be invisible—we’re not trying to say, &#8220;this is for you.&#8221; That should be self-evident. What we’re trying to avoid are scenarios where someone encounters something that communicates, &#8220;this is for someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s not too difficult, provided you know what to look out for. <a href="https://twitter.com/cariefisher">Carie Fisher</a> outlines the bulk of it in her brilliant post, <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/designing-accessible-content-typography-font-styling-and-structure--cms-31934">Designing Accessible Content: Typography, Font Styling, and Structure</a>.</p>
<h3>Priority</h3>
<p>A basic paragraph style is the wellspring from which all your other type decisions should flow. It’s probably the most common and frequently invoked content type a website has, so it’s important to treat it with the care and respect it deserves. <a href="https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period">The web is typography</a>, after all.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/heydonworks">Heydon Pickering</a> wrote about styling paragraphs way back when in 2011 with his post, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/the-perfect-paragraph/">The Perfect Paragraph</a>. And here’s the thing: eight years later, this is all still solid advice (sheesh, I’ve been doing this for awhile). When you make design decisions that work <em>with</em> the grain of the web platform, you gain the confidence that you’re creating resilient, robust, and accessible solutions that last.</p>
<p>The neat part about this is that it frees up time to do other things, say <a href="http://www.heydonworks.com/article/reluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack">reading about gender bias and the undervaluing of HTML and CSS</a>. If anything, do it for me. I am honestly not sure I can handle another case of 2,000 lines of JavaScript used to recreate <code>position: absolute;</code>. </p>
<h3>Circumstance</h3>
<h4>Form</h4>
<p>Even though responsive design is nearly a decade old at this point(!), we still seem to ignore a lot of the wisdom <a href="https://twitter.com/beep">Ethan Marcotte</a> so nicely teaches us for free. He’s a smart guy, you should <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/not-the-device/">pay attention to what he has to say</a>.</p>
<p>After a complete lack of breakpoints, perhaps the biggest offender I still come across with regards to responsive design is the assumption that a small viewport means teeny-tiny type. Typically, the opposite is true. Small devices are made to be worn or carried, meaning that <a href="https://sizecalc.com/">we move them in physical space</a> to get them into a comfortable reading position. This is the opposite of a larger, more stationary device, such as a monitor, where we move our body to accommodate it instead.</p>
<p>A comfortable reading position means not forcing someone to hold a phone two centimeters away from their face. Ergonomics aren’t likely to change, but devices will. Because of that, you should <a href="https://css-tricks.com/naming-media-queries/">craft your breakpoint names to be abstract</a>. I personally like names that keep usability in mind, so something along the lines of, &#8220;wrist, palm, lap, desk, wall.&#8221; It helps keep <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/a-design-tool/">the user’s circumstance</a> top-of-mind, and moves you away from associating only certain kinds of content as being viable on certain kinds of devices.</p>
<p>These ergonomically-derived designs can be achieved with the help from people like <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>, whose <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/tag/css-grid">in-depth explorations of CSS grid</a> help us understand the power behind a real CSS layout system. Sass experts like <a href="https://twitter.com/mirisuzanne">Miriam Suzanne</a> then teach us how to use <a href="https://oddbird.net/true/docs/">True</a> to codify these layouts and reliably integrate them into our larger Sass systems.  </p>
<p>You also want to avoid fallacious device sniffing approaches, or making gross assumptions about a user’s circumstances and capabilities. Just <a href="https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773">let me increase and decrease that type size</a>. Reader Mode lets me, so I’m going to get there one way or another. </p>
<h4>Connection</h4>
<p>The other thing you need to think about is how that ideal paragraph design actually gets served to a device. A big part of that involves loading our fonts, and ensuring that the loading process prioritizes user experience. </p>
<h5>Text</h5>
<p>Text downloads quickly; a lot faster than other exotic kinds of content. Browsers will render it gleefully, as it is historically the most important part of the payload. This means that the Reader Mode button is going to show up a lot faster than that distracting auto-playing video of talking heads so thoughtfully jammed into the bottom right-hand corner of my viewport.</p>
<p>And what if we’re on a slow, intermittent, and/or metered connection? Top-of-the-line MacBooks still have to use hotel wifi, just like everyone else. </p>
<p>You want to keep the page from jumping around when our paragraph font loads. This prevents the terrible experience of forcing me to scroll around to rediscover my place as things shift into place. It also helps prevent me from mis-clicking, taking me away from what I want to read because I had the audacity to interact with the page before <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/09/hacked-websites-mine-crypocurrencies.html">the bitcoin miners are deployed</a> (thankfully, good people like <a href="https://better.fyi/">Laura Kalbag</a> can help us with that one).</p>
<p>The temptation to hit that Reader Mode button is strong, because when I see the main text of the page show up, I know I can easily and reliably avoid all these potential issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/helenvholmes">Helen V. Holmes</a> wrote <a href="https://helenvholmes.com/writing/type-is-your-right">Type is Your Right!</a>, a beautiful article that effortlessly blends typographic history, capability, and performance. Notably, she discusses how to manage the Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) and Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) to best corral all the aforementioned issues. In response, <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Monica Dinculescu</a> made <a href="https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/">Font style matcher</a>, a fantastic tool that lets you bend, stretch, squish, squash, and torture type in ways that would make your stodgy typography professor faint, all in the service of preventing layout jank.</p>
<h5>Images</h5>
<p>You can (and should) make all sorts of clever optimizations to ensure we’re delivering our images as efficiently as possible. But what happens while I’m waiting for those images to show up? <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/what-if/">What if they never do?</a></p>
<p>Since you’re a responsible, inclusive web professional, you’ve already made sure to <a href="https://www.deque.com/blog/great-alt-text-introduction/">include alternative text descriptions</a> for our image content. <a href="https://twitter.com/ireaderinokun">Ire Aderinokun</a> teaches us that you can <a href="https://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/">take that one step further and style broken images</a>. Now even the content that isn’t working as intended looks good. No brittle, overwrought JavaScript here—just good, old fashioned progressive enhancement. </p>
<p>The other type of image you want to consider are icons. There’s <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/">lots of reasons to not use icon fonts</a>. Adding one more reason to toss on the pile: icon fonts may not hold up in Reader Mode, as they are constructed using text glyphs. When Reader Mode passes over a page, it may convert the glyph to use the font you specify. This could make for a disastrous experience, especially if the icon is used to communicate critical functionality (e.g. &#8220;Press the Home button (&#9746;) to return to the main menu.&#8221;).</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan">Sara Soueidan</a> teaches us how to <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/icon-fonts-to-svg/">convert those icon fonts to SVG</a> . But you know what? She’s so much more than just a SVG expert. She’s an incredible UX developer, and you’d do well to <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/">read up on what she’s written</a>. I, for one, have learned a ton.</p>
<h3>Control</h3>
<p>To help make my reading experience as comfortable as possible, Reader Mode allows me to adjust things like the typeface, the text and background colors, the font size and line height, and the number of words per line. This is great. I’ll frequently toggle back and forth between light and dark backgrounds depending on the time of day. </p>
<p>I also wear glasses, and I know that the older I get, the worst my vision will be. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jma245">Jennifer Aldrich</a>’s writing, I know that this is the norm. After all, <a href="https://uxmag.com/articles/we-re-just-temporarily-abled">we’re all just temporarily abled</a>. I might also need something like <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13862/windows-use-high-contrast-mode">Windows High Contrast Mode</a> one day. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliasBrain/">Amelia Bellamy-Royds</a>, I now know <a href="https://codepen.io/AmeliaBR/details/zKNJRy">how to make my content be the best it can be</a> when viewed in that mode.</p>
<p>The web is flexible. Working on it means getting over your ego and learning to let go. That means accepting that <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/11/the-myth-of-the-pixel-perfect-grid/">the medium will never be pixel perfect</a>. It means embracing technology like relative units, and more importantly, philosophies like <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jensimmons/everything-about-web-design-just-changed">Intrinsic Web Design</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Open Web continues to show up in places we would have never originally expected to find it: our phones, televisions, watches, books, video game consoles, fast food menus, gas pumps, elevators, cars—even our refrigerators. </p>
<p>By not making too many or too strict assumptions about how the web should be used, it remains flexible and adaptable. These qualities have allowed it to outperform closed technologies like Flash and Silverlight.</p>
<p>With the web’s growth comes new features to better accommodate its new form factors and use cases. One feature I’m excited about is <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#color-adjust">the <code>color-adjust</code> property</a>, proposed in <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/">CSS Color Module Level 4</a>. It is an acknowledgement that the web will continue to show up on devices that have less-than-stellar displays.</p>
<p><span id="more-274705"></span></p>
<p>There are two values for <code>color-adjust</code>: <code>economy</code> and <code>exact</code>. A value of <code>exact</code> tells the browser it shouldn’t make adjustments to the colors declared in the stylesheet:</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">.card { 
  background-color: #98b3c7;
  border-bottom: 0.25rem solid #7c92a3;
  color: #f3f3f3;
  color-adjust: exact;
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>color-adjust: exact;</code> declaration in this example forces the browser to render all colors as accurately as possible on anything with a class of <code>card</code> applied to it. Accurate meaning being as close as possible based on the host device’s best ability.</p>
<p>The description for the <code>economy</code> value <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-adjust-economy">in the specification</a> reads as, “The user agent should make adjustments to the page’s styling as it deems necessary and prudent for the output device.” It places trust in the browser’s hands, allowing it to make adjustments to color values as it sees fit.</p>
<h3>Best ability</h3>
<p>Handing control over to a browser might seem a little scary at first. As an industry, we’re really great at <a href="https://uxplanet.org/designing-systematic-colors-b5d2605b15c">bikeshedding the heck out of color systems</a>. And that’s a great thing! The use of <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/color-accessibility-workflows">color, including proper contrast ratios</a>, is an incredibly important aspect of design, and can oftentimes <a href="https://envato.com/blog/psychology-color-web-design/">make or break a product</a>.</p>
<p>But we need to understand that our platonically ideal design might not be able to be experienced in the real world as intended. Not everyone owns a device that outputs to a Retina display with a luxurious DCI-P3 color space; nor do they always have <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/lowvisionsurvey/">perfect vision</a> or ideal lighting conditions. In these kinds of circumstances, it’s better to bend, not break.</p>
<p>We now live in a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/mobile-small-portrait-slow-interlace-monochrome-coarse-non-hover-first/">Mobile, Small, Portrait, Slow, Interlace, Monochrome, Coarse, Non-Hover, First</a> world. Limited color displays aren’t as rare as you think, and are probably only going to get more commonplace as time goes on. I’d especially like to call attention to the rise of internet use by <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/">low income populations</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/986042/google-goog-designed-android-go-to-win-over-the-next-billion-smartphone-users-in-the-developing-world/">emerging markets</a>. With that comes cheaper devices with lower-quality displays.</p>
<h3>Browser support</h3>
<p>At the time of this article’s publishing, <code>color-adjust</code> has been supported since Firefox 48 (and Android Firefox 60):</p>
<p><div class="caniuse"><div class="caniuse-header"><p>This browser support data is from <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-color-adjust">Caniuse</a>, which has more detail. A number indicates that browser supports the feature at that version and up.</p></div><div class="caniuse-section"><h4>Desktop</h4><table class="browser-support-table"><thead><tr><th class="chrome"><span>Chrome</span></th><th class="firefox"><span>Firefox</span></th><th class="ie"><span>IE</span></th><th class="edge"><span>Edge</span></th><th class="safari"><span>Safari</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="y yep" title="Chrome - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">19*</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Firefox - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">48</span></td><td class="n nope" title="IE - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">No</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Edge - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">79*</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Safari - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">6*</span></td></tr></table></div><div class="caniuse-section"><h4>Mobile / Tablet</h4><table class="browser-support-table"><thead><tr><th class="and_chr"><span>Android Chrome</span></th><th class="and_ff"><span>Android Firefox</span></th><th class="android"><span>Android</span></th><th class="ios_saf"><span>iOS Safari</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="u yep-nope yep-nope-unknown" title="Android Chrome - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">81</span></td><td class="y yep" title="Android Firefox - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">68</span></td><td class="u yep-nope yep-nope-unknown" title="Android - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">81</span></td><td class="u yep-nope yep-nope-unknown" title="iOS Safari - "><span class="caniuse-agents-version version">13.4-13.5</span></td></tr></table></div></div></p>
<p>Chrome and Safari, both WebKit browsers, require a vendor-prefixed declaration of <code>-webkit-print-color-adjust</code>. Curiously, <code>-webkit-print</code> signals that their implementation of this property is only intended for print. While <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#color-adjust">the W3C documentation</a> does mention use cases for printing, it is phrased in such a way as to not be limited to it.</p>
<p>People still print webpages! Paper doesn’t require a data plan, nor does its connection drop when you go underground. Just yesterday, I saw someone on the train who was using a collection of printed sites to study for their next exam. And here’s your galaxy brain moment: printed pages are just limited color displays.</p>
<p>I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention situations where print styles are missing or poorly-authored, potentially <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/tips-and-tricks-for-print-style-sheets/#design-for-print-not-screen">forcing a printer to waste ink</a> in an attempt to do what the stylesheet asks of it. Printer ink is <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/08/the-high-cost-of-wasted-printer-ink/index.htm">hideously expensive</a>—minding this does your (or your IT department’s) budget a solid.</p>
<h3>Potential uses</h3>
<p>Before we get any further, I want to state the following is all personal theorizing based off the phrasing in the W3C specification—targeting, but not limited to printing.</p>
<p>I think <code>color-adjust</code> could be one of those properties that could find a home explicitly declared in the <code>body</code> selector, where it can best take advantage of the Cascade:</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">body {
  color-adjust: economy;
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>This declaration says, “Every time I declare color in this website, use the values I specify. If you can’t, that’s cool—do what you think is best.” That’s a lot better than the browser trying to literally interpret styling instructions at all cost, potentially rendering the page as completely illegible. </p>
<p>You could declare <code>color-adjust</code> in a more specific way, say nested in a <code>@supports</code> at-rule inside of a print media query, but that’s unnecessary extra work. It would fail to accommodate things like <a href="http://www.gwhitworth.com/blog/2017/04/how-to-use-ms-high-contrast">High Contrast Mode</a> and <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-4/#color-gamut">the upcoming color gamut media feature</a>. Better to embrace the unknown and cast a wide net.</p>
<p>I’m also very curious to see how <code>color-adjust</code> could work in conjunction with other browser capabilities, say the <a href="https://deanhume.com/ambient-light-sensor/">Ambient Light Sensor API</a> (RIP <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API">Battery Status API</a>). It’d be neat if there were opportunities to experiment with other specialized display modes—macOS’ <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph26239?locale=en_US">Night Shift</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25807?locale=en_US">Increased Contrast, Grayscale, and Reduce Transparency</a> options all come to mind.</p>
<h3>A note about accessibility</h3>
<p>I’m wondering if software (browser preference toggle or extension, bookmarklet, etc.) could be written to override what the device’s hardware reports itself as being. Much like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#User_agent_spoofing">User Agent spoofing</a>, it could “trick” a browser into thinking it has a limited color display, using <code>economy</code> to force better contrast between text and background color. This would be a lot like some <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">browser’s reading modes</a>, only page layout would be better preserved.</p>
<p>That being said, I don’t think <code>color-adjust</code> is a silver bullet for all color-related accessibility concerns. We can’t always know the device and context our websites and web apps will show up in, including what colors <code>color-adjust</code> would ultimately render as. Because of this, it’s still important to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html">mind your color contrast ratios</a>.</p>
<h3>Bending, not breaking</h3>
<p><code>color-adjust</code> feels like a natural extension of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/new-css-features-are-enhancing-everything-you-know-about-web-design/">Jen Simmons’ Intrinsic Web Design</a>: fluid and squishy UI, proportional sizing, media queries as needed, and simple declarations that do the heavy lifting. </p>
<p>The beauty of the CSS Cascade means you can <a href="http://simurai.com/blog/2015/09/09/back-to-the-roots">gracefully create intent, then adjust as needed</a>. <code>color-adjust</code>&#8216;s documentation specifically mentions a situation where it could be useful to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#valdef-color-adjust-exact">ensure a table’s zebra striping is is retained</a> when printed to make it easier to read. Such a tweak can be scoped to a single selector, without having to spend time undoing it for every other component.</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">body {
  color-adjust: economy;
  ...
}

tr {
  color-adjust: exact;
}</code></pre>
<p>The beauty of CSS’ fault tolerance means browsers that don’t understand this declaration will ignore it and continue parsing the rest of of the stylesheet. Browsers that do support it can take advantage of it, without any complicated build tool configuration or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/browser-detection-is-bad/">dangerous User Agent sniffing</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to make our web sites and web apps design adapt to the user’s environment and circumstances, and not the other way around. Good user experiences meet the user where they are, not where we hope they’ll be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone uses a mouse to browse the internet. If you’re reading this post on a smartphone, this is obvious! What’s also worth pointing out is that there are other forms of input that people use to get things done. With these forms of input comes the need for focus styles.</p>
<p><span id="more-268452"></span></p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>People are complicated. We don’t necessarily perform the same behaviors consistently, nor do we always make decisions that make sense from an outsider’s perspective. Sometimes we even do something just to… do something. We get bored easily: tinkering, poking, and prodding things to customize them to better suit our needs, regardless of their original intent.</p>
<p>People are also mortal. We can get sick and injured. Sometimes both at once. Sometimes it’s for a little while, sometimes it’s permanent. Regardless, it means that sometimes we’re unable to do things we want or need to do in the way we’re used to. </p>
<p>People also live in the world. Sometimes we’re put into an environment where external factors conspire to prevent us from doing something the way that we’re accustomed to doing it. Ever been stuck at your parents’ house during the holidays and had to use their ancient-yet-still-serviceable desktop computer? It’s like that.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Both mouse and touch input provide an indicator for interaction. For touch, it is obvious: Your finger acts as the bridge that connects your mind to the item on the screen it wants to activate. For mice, a cursor serves as a proxy for your finger.</p>
<p>However, these aren’t the only forms of input available to us. Keyboards are ubiquitous and can do just about anything a mouse or touch input can accomplish, provided you know all the right keys to press in the right order. Sometimes it’s even easier and faster than using a mouse! </p>
<p>Think about the last time you were using Cut, Copy, Paste, and Save functionality. Maybe it was the last time you were working on a spreadsheet? Were you switching between mouse and keyboard input to get things done as efficiently as possible? You probably didn’t give that behavior a second thought, but it’s a great example of switching input on the fly to best accomplish a goal. Heck, maybe you even took some &#8220;me time&#8221; during this thankless task to poke the Like button on Facebook on your smartphone.</p>
<p>If you have trouble using your hands, other options are available: <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/motor/assistive">Wands, sticks, switches, sip and puff devices, voice recognition, and eye tracking technology</a> can all create input in a digital system. These devices will <strong>identify</strong> a content area and <strong>activate</strong> it. This is similar to how you can hit the tab key on a keyboard and the next cell in a spreadsheet will be highlighted, indicating that it has been moved to and is ready to be edited.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Control Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQKEE9nI1lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In this video, video editor and accessibility consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/iAmMaccing">Christopher Hills</a> demonstrates the capabilities of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201370">Switch Control</a>, software that helps people experiencing motor control impairments use <a href="https://axesslab.com/switches/">hardware switches</a> to operate their computing devices.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that you could be relying on this technology one day, even if it’s only for a little bit. Maybe you broke both of your arms in an unfortunate mountain biking accident, and want to order some self-pity takeout while you recuperate. Maybe you’re driving and want to text your family safely. Or <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/we-re-just-temporarily-abled">maybe you’ll just get old</a>. It’s not difficult to think of other examples, it’s just not a concept people like to dwell on. </p>
<h4>If it’s interactive, it needs a focus style</h4>
<p>We can’t always know who is visiting our websites and web apps, why they’re visiting, what they’re going to do when they get there, what conditions they are experiencing, what emotions they’re feeling, or what input they may use. Analytics might provide some insight, but does not paint a full picture. It’d be foolish to have <a href="https://medium.com/adventures-in-ux-design/creating-user-centered-metrics-8c8359a3fbca">the tail wag the dog</a> and optimize the entire experience based on this snapshot of limited information.</p>
<p>It’s also important to know that not everyone who uses assistive technology wants to be <a href="https://tink.uk/thoughts-on-screen-reader-detection/">identified as an assistive technology user</a>. Nor should they be forced to disclose this. Power users&mdash;people who leverage keyboard shortcuts, specialized software, and browser extensions&mdash;may appear to navigate like a user of assistive technology, yet may not be experiencing any disability conditions. Again, people are complicated!</p>
<p>What we <em>can</em> do is preemptively provide an experience that works for everyone, regardless of ability or circumstance. </p>
<h4>Identify and activate</h4>
<h5>:focus</h5>
<p>With these alternate forms of input, how do we identify something to show it can be activated? Fortunately, CSS has this problem handled&mdash;we use the <code>:focus</code> and <code>:active</code> selectors. </p>
<p>The grammar is straightforward. Want to outline a link in orange when a user focuses on it? Here’s how to describe it:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="language-css"><code>a:focus {
  outline: 3px solid orange;
}</code></pre>
<p>This outline will appear when someone navigates to the link, be it by clicking or tapping, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/">tabbing to it via keyboard input</a>, or using switch input to highlight it.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that the focus style can only use the <code>outline</code> property. It’s worth noting that <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/focus/"><code>:focus</code> is a selector</a> like any other, meaning that it accepts the full range of CSS properties. I like to play with background color, underlining, and other techniques that don’t adjust the component’s current size, so as to not shift page layout when the selector is activated.</p>
<p>Then say we want to remove the link’s underline when activated to communicate <a href="https://css-tricks.com/user-facing-state/">a shift in state</a>. Remember: <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2016/06/on-link-underlines.html" style="text-decoration:underline;">links use underlines</a>!</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="language-css"><code>a:active {
  text-decoration: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>It’s important to make sure the state changes, from <em>resting</em> to <em>focused</em> to <em>activated</em>, are distinct. This means that each transition should be unique when compared to the component’s other states, allowing the user to understand that a change has occurred. </p>
<p>We also want to make sure these state changes don’t rely on color alone, to best accommodate people experiencing color blindness and/or low vision. Here’s how a color-only state change might look to a person with Deuteranopia, commonly known as Red-Green colorblindness:</p>
<p><iframe title="No hover/focus state with simulated color blindness and cataracts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttMGeB1pTgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I purposely removed the underline and the browser’s native focus ring from the link in the video to better illustrate the issue of discoverability. When trying to tab around the page to determine what is interactive, it isn’t immediately obvious that there is a link present. If colorblindness is also a factor, the state change when hovered won’t be apparent—this is even more apparent with the addition of cataracts.</p>
<h5>:focus-within</h5>
<p><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-within-pseudo"><code>:focus-within</code></a>&mdash;a focus-related pseudo class selector with a very Zen-sounding name&mdash;can apply styling to a parent element when one of its children receives focus. The focus event bubbles out until it encounters a CSS rule asking it to apply its styling instructions.</p>
<p>A common use case for this selector would be to apply styling to an entire form when one of its input elements receives focus. In the example below, I’m scaling up the size of the entire form slightly, unless the user has expressed a desire for <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/">a reduced animation experience</a>:</p>
<p data-height="430" style="height: 430px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="KQOpRM" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title=":focus-within Demo" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/KQOpRM/">:focus-within Demo</a> by Eric Bailey (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey">@ericwbailey</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>The selector is still <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=focus-within">relatively new</a>, so I’m sure we’ll get <a href="http://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/05/14/focus-within.html">more clever applications</a> as time goes on.</p>
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>People also have opinions. Unfortunately, sometimes these opinions are uninformed. Outside the practice of accessibility there’s the prevalent notion that focus styles are &#8220;ugly&#8221; and many designers and developers remove them for the sake of perceived aesthetics. Sometimes they’re not even aware they’re propagating someone else’s opinion&mdash;many <a href="https://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/">CSS resets</a> include a blanket removal of focus styles and are incorporated as a foundational project dependency with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/reboot-resets-reasoning/">no questions asked</a>. </p>
<p>This decision excludes people. Websites and web apps aren’t close-cropped trophies to be displayed without context on a dribbble profile, nor are they static screenshots on a slick corporate sales deck. They exist to be read and acted upon, and there’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">rules that help</a> ensure that the largest possible amount of people can do exactly that. </p>
<h4>:focus-visible</h4>
<p>The fact of the matter is that sometimes people will insist on removing focus styles, and have enough clout to force their cohorts to carry out their vision. This flies in the face of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html">rules that stipulate that focus mechanisms must be visible</a> for websites to be truly accessible. To get around this, we have <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo">the <code>:focus-visible</code> pseudo-selector</a>. </p>
<p><code>:focus-visible</code> pseudo-selector styling kicks in when the browser determines that a focus event occurred, and User Agent heuristics inform it that non-pointer input is being used. That’s a fancy way of saying it shows focus styling when activated via input via other than mouse cursor or finger tap.</p>
<p><iframe title=":focus-visible Example" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZwEW-NnkYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The video of <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/eff11961bab8b61c2aaeb548e70ffbd5">this CodePen</a> demonstrates how different styling is applied based on the kind of input the link receives. When a link is hovered and clicked on via mouse input, its underline is removed and shifts down slightly. When tabbed to via keyboard input, :focus-visible applies a stark background color to the link instead.</p>
<p>Chromium has recently announced its <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/897002">intent to implement <code>:focus-visible</code></a>. Although <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-focus-visible">browser support is currently extremely limited</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible#polyfill">polyfill is available</a>. Both it and <code>:focus-within</code> are in the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/">Selectors Level 4 Editor’s Draft</a>, and therefore likely to have native support in the major browsers sooner than later.</p>
<p>You may know <code>:focus-visible</code> by its other name, <code>:-moz-focusring</code>. This vendor prefixed pseudo-selector is Mozilla’s implementation of the idea, predating the <code>:focus-visible</code> proposal by <a href="http://mdn.beonex.com/en/CSS/%3A-moz-focusring">seven years</a>. Unlike other vendor prefixed CSS, we’re not going to have to worry about <a href="https://autoprefixer.github.io/">autoprefixing support</a>! Firefox honors a <code>:focus-visible</code> declaration as well as <code>:-moz-focusring</code>, ensuring there will be parity for our selector names between the two browsers.</p>
<h4>One step forward, one step back</h4>
<p>Browser support is a bit of a rub&mdash;<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/">the web is more than just Chrome and Firefox</a>. While the polyfill may provide support where there is none natively, it’s <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/">extra data to download</a>, extra complexity to maintain, and <a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">extra fragility</a> added to your payload.</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that devices are far less binary about their input types than they used to be. The Surface, Microsoft’s flagship computer, offers keyboard, trackpad, stylus, camera, voice, and touch capability out of the box. WebAIM’s 2017 Screen Reader Survey revealed that <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/#mobilekeyboard">mobile devices may be augmented by keyboard input</a> more than you may think. Heuristics are nice, but like analytics, may not paint a complete picture.</p>
<p>Another point to consider is that focus styles can be desirable for mouse users. Their presence is a clear and unambiguous indication of interactivity, which is a great affordance for people with low vision conditions, <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/">cognitive concerns</a>, and people who are less technologically adept. Extraordinarily technologically adept people, ones who grok that screen readers and keyboard shortcuts are essentially <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> for a GUI, will want the focus state to be apparent as they use the keyboard to dance across the screen.</p>
<p>Part of building a robust, resilient web involves building <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/how-to-write-css-that-works-in-every-browser-even-the-old-ones/">a strong core experience that works in every browser</a>. The vanilla <code>:focus</code> selector enjoys both wide and deep support to the degree that it’s a safe bet that even <a href="https://twitter.com/drewm/status/977882252943200257">exotic browsers</a> will honor it.</p>
<p>The world is full of things that some people may see as ugly, while others find them to be beautiful. Personally, I don’t see focus styles as an eyesore. As a designer, I think that it’s a foundational part of creating a mature design system. As a developer, describing state is just business as usual. As a person, I enjoy helping to <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">keep the web open and accessible</a>, as it was intended to be. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://tink.uk/understanding-semantics/">semantics inherent in HTML elements</a> tell us what we’re supposed to use them for. Need a heading?

<p><span id="more-265869"></span></p>
<h3>Buttons Do Things, Links Go Places</h3>
<p>There seems to be a lot of confusion over <a href="https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications/">when to use buttons and when to use links</a>. Much like tabs versus spaces or pullover hoodies versus zip-ups, this debate might rage without end. </p>
<p>However, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#downloading-resources">W3C provides us with an important clue</a> as to who is right: the <code>download</code> attribute. </p>
<h3>The What Now?</h3>
<p>The internet as we know it couldn’t exist without links. They form <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">the Semantic Web</a>, the terribly wonderful, wonderfully terrible tangled ball of information that enables you to read this article at this very moment.</p>
<p>Like all other elements, anchor links can be modified by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes">HTML’s global attributes</a>. Anchor link elements also possess a number of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#Attributes">unique attributes</a> that help control how they connect to other documents and files.</p>
<p>One of those attributes is called <code>download</code>. It tells the browser that the destination of the link should be saved to your device instead of visiting it. You’re still &#8220;navigating&#8221; to the file, only instead of viewing it, you’re snagging a copy for your own use. </p>
<p>Any kind of file can be a download! This even includes HTML, something the browser would typically display. The presence of the attribute is effectively a human-authored flag that tells the browser to skip trying to render something it has retrieved and just store it instead:</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code>&lt;a download href="recipe.html"&gt;
  Download recipe
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This raises a very important point: we can’t know every user’s reason for why they’re visiting our website, but we can use the tools made available to us to help guide them along their way. If that means storing an HTML document for use offline, we’re empowered to help make the experience as easy as possible.</p>
<h3>Other Evidence</h3>
<p>Still not convinced? Here’s some more food for thought:</p>
<h4>Progressive Enhancement</h4>
<p>JavaScript is more brittle <a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">than we care to admit</a>. <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements function even if JavaScript breaks. Using anchors for your download means that a person can access what they need, even in suboptimal situations.</p>
<p>A robust solution is always the most desirable&mdash;in a time of crisis, it might even save a life. This might sound hyperbolic, but having <a href="https://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4240170_Adult_ready_reference.pdf">a stable copy of something that works offline</a> could make all the difference in a time of need.</p>
<h4>Semantics and Accessibility</h4>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.scottohara.me/">Scott</a>, who is paid to know these kinds of things, tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The debate about whether a button or link should be used to download a file is a bit silly, as the whole purpose of a link has always been to download content. HTML is a file, and like all other files, it needs to be retrieved from a server and downloaded before it can be presented to a user.</p>
<p>The difference between a Photoshop file, HTML, and other understood media files, is that a browser automatically displays the latter two. If one were to link to a Photoshop <code>.psd</code> file, the browser would initiate a document change to render the file, likely be all like, &#8220;lol wut?&#8221; and then just initiate the OS download prompt.</p>
<p>The confusion seems to come from developers getting super literal with the &#8220;links go places, buttons perform actions.&#8221; Yes, that is true, <strong>but links don’t actually go anywhere</strong>. They <strong>retrieve information and download it</strong>. Buttons perform actions, but they don’t inherently &#8220;get&#8221; documents. While they can be used to get data, it’s often to change state of a current document, not to retrieve and render a new one. They can <code>get</code> data, in regards to the functionality of <code>form</code>s, but it continues to be within the context of updating a web document, not downloading an individual file.</p>
<p>Long story short, the <code>download</code> attribute is unique to anchor links for a reason. <code>download</code> augments the inherent functionality of the link retrieving data. It side steps the attempt to render the file in the browser and instead says, &#8220;You know what? I’m just going to save this for later&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Scott!</p>
<h3>Designing a Good Download Link</h3>
<p>The default experience of downloading a file can be jarring&mdash;it typically isn’t part of our normal browsing behavior. The user has to shift their mental model from flitting from page-to-page and filling out forms to navigating a file system and extracting compressed archives. For less technologically-savvy individuals, it can be a disorienting and frustrating context shift. </p>
<p>As responsible designers and developers, we want to make the experience of interacting with a download link as good as it possibly can be. As we can’t modify how the browser’s download behavior itself operates, we should make the surrounding user experience as transparent and streamlined as possible.</p>
<h4>Tell Me What’s in Store</h4>
<p>Give the user as much information as you can to help inform them on what’s about to happen. Anticipating and answering the following questions can help:</p>
<h5>What?</h5>
<p>Verb plus noun is the winning combination. Describe what the link does and what it gets you:</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code>&lt;a download href="downloads/fonts.zip"&gt;
  Download Fonts
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>By itself, the verb <em>Download</em> would only signal what behavior will be triggered when the link is activated. Including the noun <em>Fonts</em> is great for removing ambiguity about what you’ll be getting.</p>
<p>In cases where there’s multiple download links on a page, the presence of the noun will help <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind.html">users navigating via screen reader</a>. Here’s what it would sound like if you were browsing a page that had eight noun-less download links:</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/381077990&amp;color=ff5500"></iframe></p>
<p>Do you know which one of those eight links gets you what you want? No? That’s not great. Similarly, the presence of the <code>download</code> attribute on an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element won’t be announced by screen readers, so the verb is equally vital. It’s important to provide context!</p>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945">obvious always wins</a>. While it is possible to make your compliance checks happy by using a <a href="https://gomakethings.com/hidden-content-for-better-a11y/">visually hidden CSS class</a> to hide the noun portion of your download, it places extra cognitive burden on your users. A hidden noun also sacrifices functionality like the browser’s search-on-page capability.</p>
<h5>How Long?</h5>
<p>KB, MB, GB, TB. We’re not talking about Kobe Beef, Mega Bloks, Ginkgo Biloba, or Tuberculosis. We’re talking about the size of the download, and consequently how long it will take for the download to finish. </p>
<p>Know your audience. A file with a size of 128 <abbr title="Kilobytes">KB</abbr> will download much faster than a file with a size of 2 <abbr title="Gigabytes">GB</abbr>, yet its number is drastically larger. Unless your audience has familiarity with the terminology used to describe file size, they may not understand what they’re getting themselves into if you only tell them the size of the payload.</p>
<p>For larger files, the wait time can be especially problematic. A standard download is an all-or-nothing affair&mdash;interruptions can corrupt them and render them useless. Worse, it can waste valuable data on a metered data plan, an unfortunately <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/">all-too-relevant concern</a>.</p>
<p>It is also incredibly difficult to accurately ascertain someone’s current connection speed. While the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/nic62#network-info">Network Information API</a> looks promising, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Navigator/connection#Browser_compatibility">current browser support</a> isn’t so hot. </p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.twnsnd.com/posts/nothing_excuses_you_from_web_performance_optimisation.html">hidden nuance</a> living in the gap between reported and actual connection. A high speed <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G">5G connection</a> could drop the second someone enters a tunnel or walks to a spot in their house where coverage isn’t good. This isn’t even beginning to cover the complexities involved with throttling, an unfortunately <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjdjd4/100-million-americans-only-have-one-isp-option-internet-broadband-net-neutrality">all-too-real concern</a>. </p>
<p>To address these issues, apply a little micro-copy:</p>
<p data-height="400" style="height: 400px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="baByyw" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Download movie" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/baByyw/">Download movie</a> by Eric Bailey (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey">@ericwbailey</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>Your user is going to know the particulars of their connection quality better than you ever will. Now they have what they need to make an informed decision, with a little intentional ambiguity to temper expectations. </p>
<p>But what about progress bars?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_bar">Progress bars</a> are <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> elements that show how close a computational task is to completion. For <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designers, they’re a staple (and an opportunity to <a href="http://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-to-make-progress-bars-feel-faster-to-users/">play around with perceived performance</a>). However, I’m wary of employing them when it comes to downloads.</p>
<p>At best, they’re redundant. Browsers already supply <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> to indicate how the download is progressing. At worst, they’re a confusing liability. Adding them introduces unnecessary implementation and maintenance complications&mdash;especially when combined with the issues in determining connection speed and quality outlined earlier.</p>
<h5>Why?</h5>
<p>Sell the user on why they should care. Will it remove frustration by fixing an existing problem? Will it increase enjoyment by adding a new feature? Will it reassure by making things more secure? While not every download needs the &#8220;why?&#8221; question answered, it is good to have for payloads with a complicated or esoteric purpose.</p>
<p>If I am downloading router firmware, I may not understand (or care about) the nitty-gritty of what the update does behind the scenes. However, some high-level communication about <em>why</em> I need to undertake the endeavor will go a long way. </p>
<p data-height="425" style="height: 425px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="jYMVwm" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Describe what the download does" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/jYMVwm/">Describe what the download does</a> by Eric Bailey (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey">@ericwbailey</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<h5>What Next?</h5>
<p>Instructions on what to do after the download has completed could be useful. Again, knowing your audience is key.</p>
<p>With our router example, it is entirely possible that less technically-savvy individuals will find themselves on the product support page. It’s also highly possible that they’re in a distressed emotional state when they arrive. After a download has been initiated, step-by-step information on how to install the new firmware, as well as links to relevant support resources could go a long way to alleviating negative feelings.</p>
<p>This is practical empathy. Anticipating the user’s needs and emotional state and preemptively offering solutions has a direct effect on things like reducing expensive support calls. These savings means organizational resources can be reallocated to other important endeavors.</p>
<h4>Taking it to Code</h4>
<h5>Signal That it’s Different</h5>
<p><a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2016/06/on-link-underlines.html">Links use underlines.</a> </p>
<p>A good practice from both a user experience and an accessibility perspective is to create <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html">a distinction between internal and external links</a>. This means creating an indicator that a link does something other than take you to another place on your website or webapp. For links that go off-site, a common practice is to use an arrow breaking out of a box. For downloads, a downward-facing arrow is the de facto standard.</p>
<figure id="post-265878" class="align-none media-265878"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/download-links.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Examples of icons for downloads (top) and external links (bottom). Courtesy of <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project.</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some may feel that the presence of the <code>download</code> attribute is redundant when applied to links the browser already knows to store. I disagree.</p>
<p>In addition to being an unambiguous semantic marker in the HTML, the <code>download</code> attribute can serve as a simple and elegant styling hook. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/">CSS attribute selectors</a>&mdash;code that lets us create styling based on the qualities that help describe HTML elements&mdash;allow us to target any link that is a download and style it without having to attach a special class:</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">a[download] {
  color: hsla(216, 70%, 53%, 1);
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a[download]::before {
  content: url('../icons/icon-download.svg');
  height: 1em;
  position: relative;
  top: 0.75em;
  right: 0.5em;
  width: 1em;
}

a[download]:hover,
a[download]:focus {
  text-decoration: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>Combined with the text describing the download, the presence of the icon clearly communicates that when you activate this link, download behavior will follow. It also provides extra target area, great for touch devices. </p>
<p>Targeting both the presence of the <code>download</code> attribute <em>and</em> the file extension at the end of the string in the <code>href</code> attribute allows us to get even fancier. We can take advantage of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade">the cascade</a> to set up a consistent treatment for all icons, but change the icon itself on a per-filetype basis. This is great for situations where there are multiple kinds of things you can download on a single page:</p>
<p data-height="400" style="height: 400px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="rpNQoo" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Download icons" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/rpNQoo/">Download icons</a> by Eric Bailey (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey">@ericwbailey</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>I maintain <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericwbailey/c9f180e11afc6c5d2b5d3d3dd9516258">a list of common filetypes</a>, if you’re looking for a starting point. Remember to only include the selectors you need, so as to not create unnecessary bloat in your production CSS. If your website or webapp features many icons and/or a lot of fancy state management, consider using a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/building-icon-systems-with-svg">SVG icon system</a> instead. It will improve performance—just remember to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/">make it accessible</a>!</p>
<h5>Name the Payload</h5>
<p>The <code>download</code> attribute can accept an optional value, allowing the author to create a custom, human-friendly name for the downloaded file. In this example, we’re changing the name of a podcast episode to something that makes sense when downloaded to the user’s device, while maintaining something that makes sense to the podcast’s producer:</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code>&lt;a 
  download="Pod-People-Podcast-Episode-12-Feed-Me-Seymour.mp3"
  href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/txf5933cwxhv1so6/12-final-v5-RADIO-EDIT.m4a?dl=0"&gt;
  Download Episode 12
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For complicated sites, this attribute allows us to create downloads that make sense to the person requesting them, while also taking advantage of features like <abbr title="Content Delivery Networks">CDNs</abbr> and dynamically-generated files. Not a lot of complicated backend sorcery here, just a little template logic:</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code>&lt;a 
  href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ky22o6s6g8be80bak577b17e34bb93cex3.pdf"
  download="{{ user.name | slugify }}-{{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}-tax-return.pdf"&gt;
  Download your {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }} Tax Return
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Material Honesty</h3>
<p>Keeping content looking and behaving like the HTML elements used to describe it is great for reinforcing <a href="http://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/#be-consistent">external consistency</a>. Externally consistent content is great for ensuring people can, and will use your website or webapp. Use is great for engagement, a metric that makes business-types happy. </p>
<p>And yet, <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/#problematic">link-y buttons and button-y links are everywhere</a>.</p>
<p>We can lay blame for this semantic drift squarely at the feet of trend. Designers and developers eager to try the latest and greatest invite ambiguity in with outstretched arms. Leadership chases perceived value to stay relevant. </p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. Websites can be both <a href="https://a11ywins.tumblr.com/post/159988043603/shopify-polaris-design-system">beautiful and accessible</a>. Semantics and current frameworks/aesthetics aren’t mutually exclusive. Take a little time to review the fundamentals—you just might discover something simple that helps everyone get what they need with just a little bit less fuss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much like their physical counterparts, the materials we use to build websites have purpose. To use them without understanding their strengths and limitations is irresponsible. Nobody wants to live in an poorly-built house. So why are poorly-built websites acceptable? </p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to address <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA</a>, and how misusing it can do more harm than good.</p>
<p><span id="more-262085"></span></p>
<h3>Materials as technology</h3>
<p>In construction, spackle is used to fix minor defects on interiors. It is a thick paste that dries into a solid surface that can be sanded smooth and painted over. Most renters become acquainted with it when attempting to get their damage deposit back.</p>
<p>Rebar is a lattice of steel rods used to reinforce concrete. Every modern building uses it—chances are good you&#8217;ll see it walking past any decent-sized construction site.</p>
<h3>Technology as materials</h3>
<p>HTML is the rebar-reinforced concrete of the web. To stretch the metaphor, CSS is the interior and exterior decoration, and JavaScript is the wiring and plumbing.</p>
<p>Every tag in HTML has what is known as <strong>native semantics</strong>. The act of writing an HTML element programmatically communicates to the browser what that tag represents. Writing a <code>button</code> tag explicitly tells the browser, &#8220;This is a button. It <a href="https://css-tricks.com/use-button-element/">does buttony things</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason this is so important is that assistive technology hooks into native semantics and uses it to create an interface for navigation. A page not described semantically is a lot like a building without rooms or windows: <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind.html">People navigating via a screen reader</a> have to wander around aimlessly in the dark and hope they stumble onto what they need.</p>
<p><abbr><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">ARIA</a></abbr> stands for <dfn>Accessible Rich Internet Applications</dfn> and is a relatively new specification developed to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Web_applications_and_ARIA_FAQ">help assistive technology better communicate</a> with dynamic, JavaScript-controlled content. It is intended to supplement <a href="https://css-tricks.com/user-facing-state/">existing semantic attributes</a> by providing enhanced interactivity and context to screen readers and other assistive technology.</p>
<h3>Using spackle to build walls</h3>
<p>A concerning trend I&#8217;ve seen recently is the blind, mass-application of ARIA. It feels like an attempt by developers to conduct accessibility compliance via buckshot—throw enough of something at a target trusting that you&#8217;ll eventually hit it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a very real danger to this approach. Misapplied ARIA has the potential to <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/10/dont-use-aria-menu-roles-for-site-nav.html">do more harm than good</a>. </p>
<p>The semantics inherent in ARIA means that when applied improperly it can create a discordant, contradictory mess when read via screen reader. Instead of hearing, &#8220;This is a button. It does buttony things.&#8221;, people begin to hear things along the lines of, &#8220;This is nothing, but also a button. But it&#8217;s also a deactivated checkbox that is disabled and it needs to shout that constantly.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.<br />
– <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1">First rule of ARIA use</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, ARIA is a new technology. This means that <a href="https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/">browser support and behavior is varied</a>. While I am optimistic that in the future the major browsers will have <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=wai-aria">complete and unified support</a>, the <a href="http://www.heydonworks.com/article/aria-controls-is-poop">current landscape has gaps and bugs</a>.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is who actually uses the technology. Compliance isn&#8217;t some purely academic vanity metric we&#8217;re striving for. We&#8217;re building robust systems for real people that allow them to get what they want or need with <a href="http://www.clickawaypound.com/cap16finalreport.html">as little complication as possible</a>. Many people who use assistive technology are reluctant to upgrade for fear of breaking functionality. Ever get irritated when your favorite program redesigns and you have to re-learn how to use it? Yeah.</p>
<blockquote><p>The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.<br />
– Tim Berners-Lee</p></blockquote>
<p>It feels disingenuous to see the benefits of the <abbr title="Don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> principal of massive JavaScript frameworks also slather redundant and misapplied attributes in their markup. The web is <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">accessible by default</a>. For better or for worse, we are free to do what we want to it after that. </p>
<h3>The fix</h3>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say we should completely avoid using ARIA. When applied with skill and precision, it can turn a confusing or frustrating user experience into an intuitive and effortless one, with far fewer brittle hacks and workarounds.</p>
<p>A little goes a long way. <strong>Before considering other options, start with markup that semantically describes the content it is wrapping</strong>. Test extensively, and only apply ARIA if deficiencies between HTML&#8217;s native semantics and JavaScript&#8217;s interactions arise.</p>
<p>Development teams will appreciate the advantage of terse code that&#8217;s easier to maintain. Savvy developers will use a CSS-Trick&#x2122; and leverage <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">CSS attribute selectors</a> to create systems where visual presentation is tied to semantic meaning.</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">input:invalid,
[aria-invalid] {
  border: 4px dotted #f64100;
}</code></pre>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here are a few of the more common patterns I&#8217;ve seen recently, and why they are problematic. This doesn&#8217;t mean these are the only kinds of errors that exist, but it&#8217;s a good primer on recognizing what not to do:</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;li role="listitem"&gt;Hold the Bluetooth button on the speaker for three seconds to make the speaker discoverable&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The role is redundant. The native semantics of the <code>li</code> element already describe it as a list item.</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;p role="command"&gt;Type CTRL+P to print&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p><code>command</code> is an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#h-abstract_roles">Abstract Role</a>. They are <strong>only</strong> used in ARIA to help describe its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#state_prop_taxonomy">taxonomy</a>. Just because an ARIA attribute seems like it is applicable doesn&#8217;t mean it necessarily is. Additionally, the <code>kbd</code> tag could be used on &#8220;CTRL&#8221; and &#8220;P&#8221; to more accurately describe the keyboard command.</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;div role="button" class="button"&gt;Link to device specifications&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Failing to use a <code>button</code> tag runs the risk of not accommodating all the different ways a user can interact with a button and how the browser responds. In addition, the <code>a</code> tag should be <a href="https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications/">used for links</a>.</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;body aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Usually the intent behind something like this is to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/hiding-and-updating-content#aria-live">expose updates to the screen reader user</a>. Unfortunately, when scoped to the body tag, any page change—including all JS-related updates—are announced immediately. A setting of <code>assertive</code> on <code>aria-live</code> also means that each update interrupts whatever it is the user is currently doing. This is a disastrous experience, especially for single page apps.</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;div aria-checked="true"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/05/under-engineered-custom-radio-buttons-and-checkboxen.html">style a native checkbox element</a> to look like whatever you want it to. Better support! Less work!</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;div role="link" tabindex="40"&gt;
  <a href="/" role="button" tabindex="12" title="link text">Link text</a>
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/scottohara/status/926450432683241472">actual production code</a>. Where to begin? First, <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/1.1/tabindex">never use a <code>tabindex</code> value greater than 0</a>. Secondly, <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/01/html5-accessibility-chops-title-attribute-use-and-abuse/">the title attribute probably does not do what you think it does</a>. Third, the anchor tag should have a destination—links take you places, after all. Fourth, the role of <code>link</code> assigned to a <code>div</code> wrapping an <code>a</code> element is entirely superfluous.</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-html">&lt;h2 class="h3" role="heading" aria-level="1"&gt;How to make a perfect soufflé every time&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Credit is where credit&#8217;s due: <a href="http://incl.ca/heading-headache/">Nicolas Steenhout outlines the issues for this one</a>.</p>
<h3>Do better</h3>
<p>Much like <a href="https://responsivedesign.is/design/content-first-design/">content</a>, markup shouldn&#8217;t be an afterthought when building a website. I believe most people are genuinely trying to do their best most of the time, but wielding a technology without knowing its implications is dangerous and irresponsible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m usually more of a honey-instead-of-vinegar kind of person when I try to get people to practice accessibility, but not here. This isn&#8217;t a soft sell about the benefits of developing and designing with an accessible, inclusive mindset. It&#8217;s a post about doing your job.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every decision a team makes affects a site&#8217;s accessibility.<br />
– <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone">Laura Kalbag</a></p></blockquote>
<h4>Get better at authoring</h4>
<p>Learn about <a href="http://html5doctor.com/">the available HTML tags</a>, what they describe, and how to best use them. Same goes for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/">ARIA</a>. Give your page template semantics the same care and attention you give your JavaScript during code reviews.</p>
<h4>Get better at testing</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s little excuse to not incorporate a screen reader into your testing and QA process. <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> is free. <a href="https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/10.12/">macOS</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-narrator-get-started">Windows</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en">Android</a> all come with screen readers built in. Some nice people have even <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/basic-screen-reader-commands-for-accessibility-testing/">written guides to help you learn how to use them</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tenon.io/">Automated accessibility testing</a> is a huge boon, but it also isn&#8217;t a silver bullet. It won&#8217;t report on what it doesn&#8217;t know to report, meaning it&#8217;s up to a human to manually determine if navigating through the website makes sense. This isn&#8217;t any different than other usability testing endeavors.</p>
<h3>Build better buildings</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design">Universal Design</a> teaches us that websites, like buildings, can be <a href="https://a11ywins.tumblr.com/post/159988043603/shopify-polaris-design-system">both beautiful and accessible</a>.

It stands to reason that the more attention paid to the legibility of your text, the more effectively you convey a message.</p>
<p><span id="more-260620"></span></p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to dive deep into a seemingly simple typesetting topic—effective use of letter-spacing—and how it relates to web typography.</p>
<h3>Some history</h3>
<p>Letter-spacing, or character spacing, is the area between all letters in a line of text. Manipulation of this space is intended to increase or decrease the visual density of a line or block of text. </p>
<p>When working in print, typographers also refer to it as <em>tracking</em>. It is not to be confused with <em>kerning</em>, which refers to the manipulation of space between two individual letters. Kerning is not usually practiced on the web.</p>
<p data-height="450" style="height: 450px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="f90cc6d55dbee5c7c0c176dd0342c91d" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Letter-spacing vs. Kerning" data-editable="true" class="codepen"><a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/f90cc6d55dbee5c7c0c176dd0342c91d">See the Pen.</a></p>
<p>Historically, manipulating letter-spacing was a technique frequently used when laying out newspapers. The pressure of quick deadlines meant that reporters didn&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to rewrite sentences to better fit the physical space allotted for them on the page. To work around this, designers would insert spacing between the letters—first by hand and then later digitally—so that a line of type would better fill the allotted space.</p>
<p>On the web where available space is potentially infinite, letter-spacing is usually employed for its other prominent historical use case: creating a distinct aesthetic effect for content such as titles and headlines, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_quote">pull quotes</a>, and banners.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://utility-opentype.kennethormandy.com/">fine typographic control on the web</a> is only a recent development, the ability to perform <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/#letter-spacing">letter-spacing has been around since CSS1</a>. Naturally, the name of this property is called <code>letter-spacing</code>.</p>
<p><code>letter-spacing</code> accepts various kinds of lengths as a value. Unlike its physical counterpart, it can be set to a negative measurement, which moves the letters closer together instead of further apart. When setting print type, no competent typesetter would have cut chunks out of their lead type to achieve this effect. However, when your letters are virtual, you can do whatever you want with them!</p>
<h4>Stealing Sheep</h4>
<p>In researching the history of letter-spacing, you&#8217;re likely to run across a famous quote by type designer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy">Frederic Goudy</a>. The—ahem—clean version is, &#8220;Anyone who would letter-space lower case would steal sheep.&#8221; Essentially, Goudy is saying that manipulating type without knowing the rules is bad.</p>
<p>Some have taken this quote at face value and sworn to never apply letter-spacing to content containing any amount of lower case text. While I would never presume to be as skilled or as knowledgeable about typography as Goudy, I would caution against <a href="https://css-tricks.com/increasing-wariness-dogmatism/">the pitfalls of dogmatism</a>.</p>
<p>There are situations where it would be advantageous to <a href="http://webtypography.net/2.1.7">apply letter-spacing to large sections of text</a>, so long as it is in the service of optimizing legibility. For example, a judicious application of letter-spacing applied to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate_(typography)">legal copy or agate</a> provides a much-needed assist in a situation where the reader is navigating small, dense, jargon-filled content.</p>
<p>Much like practicing good typography, writing great CSS is all about minding the details—even a single property can contain a great deal of hidden complexity. Understanding the history, capabilities, and limitations of the technology allows for the creation of robust, beautiful solutions that everyone can use, regardless of device or ability.</p>
<p>If you would like to manipulate the letter-spacing of text on your website, here are some guidelines on how to do it well and avoid making mistakes.</p>
<h3>Use letter-spacing, not spacing characters</h3>
<p>In print, creating space between each letter in a line of metal or movable type historically involved inserting small pieces of metal between each letter. However, on the web you want to avoid adding any extra <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph">glyphs</a>—such as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/space-yourself/#meet-the-spaces">spacing characters</a>—between each typed letter. If you need to achieve the visual effect of letter-spaced type, use the <code>letter-spacing</code> property. This one might seem obvious, but you&#8217;d be surprised!</p>
<h4>Maintainability</h4>
<p>If spacing characters <em>are</em> used, future styling changes will be more difficult to make and maintain. Every typeface has different widths. It is harder to predict or control how potential redesigns might behave, especially when making typesetting decisions for larger sites with a lot of varied content.</p>
<p data-height="325" style="height: 325px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="0543f5931e2db6a78d2258347ee63350" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Varying glyph widths" data-editable="true" class="codepen"><a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/0543f5931e2db6a78d2258347ee63350">See the Pen.</a></p>
<p>If you find this is an emergent behavior amongst multiple site authors, you should investigate codifying it by updating site styles to reflect this desired aesthetic. This may also necessitate talking to designers to update style guides and other relevant branding documents.</p>
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>If letters are separated by spacing characters, some screen readers will read each letter individually instead of the whole word. In this scenario, usability is sacrificed for the sake of authoring ergonomics—browsing becomes labored and people get unnecessarily excluded from using your site.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/not-all-screen-reader-users-are-blind.html">your eyesight isn&#8217;t as great as it is now</a>. Your experience on the web would be a lot like this:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dFhoUrWDcI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This issue won&#8217;t trigger automated accessibility checks, so it&#8217;s important to audit manually. Like two spaces after a period, this practice is <a href="http://uxmovement.com/content/6-surprising-bad-practices-that-hurt-dyslexic-users/">a bad habit</a>, so further violations can usually be found on a per-author basis.</p>
<h3>Non-unitless values</h3>
<p>The <code>letter-spacing</code> property uses a non-unitless value to determine how far apart letters are spaced. While <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length">CSS offers a range of units</a> to choose from, there are some values to be avoided:</p>
<h4>Pixels and other absolute units</h4>
<p>Much like manually inserting spaces to create a letter-spacing effect, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Absolute_length_units">absolute units</a> such as pixels also make it difficult to predict what might happen when you inevitably update or change any type styles or faces. Unlike <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Relative_length_units">relative units</a>, these static units will only scale proportionately to themselves when zoomed. Some older browsers won&#8217;t scale them at all.</p>
<p>In terms of maintainability, static units are also problematic. What might work well defined in pixels for one typeface might not look great for another, as different typefaces have different widths for their glyphs. If you ever change your brand&#8217;s typeface, updating precisely measured pixel values across your entire site becomes a large chore.</p>
<h4>Relative units</h4>
<p>The size of a relative unit is determined by measuring it against the size of something else. For example, viewport units size things relative to the browser&#8217;s height and width—something styled with a <code>width: 5vw;</code> will have a width of 5% of the width of the browser (admittedly an oversimplification, this isn&#8217;t a post about the nuances of browser UI).</p>
<p>For letter-spacing English and other Romance languages, the <code>em</code> unit is what you&#8217;re going to want to use.</p>
<p>Historically, ems were measured by the width of a capital M—typically the widest character in the alphabet—or later, the height of all the metal type in <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface">the font&#8217;s set</a>. In web typography, <code>em</code>s are potentially based off of a stack of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The browser&#8217;s default font size (<a href="https://nicolas-hoizey.com/2016/03/people-don-t-change-the-default-16px-font-size-in-their-browser.html">typically 16px, but not always</a>).</li>
<li>A user-specified default font size.</li>
<li>The font size declared on the root of the page (typically applied to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag).</li>
<li>The font size declared on a containing parent element.</li>
<li>The font size declared by a style.</li>
<li>The font size set by a special operating mode such as browser zoom or extension, OS preferences, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the nerdish pride you&#8217;ll feel paying homage to the great typographers of generations past, em-based letter-spacing will always be relative to the font size you&#8217;ve declared. This gives the assurance that things will always be properly and proportionately scaled.</p>
<p><code>rem</code>s, ems younger sibling, operate in a similar way. The main difference is that they are always proportional to the root font size (but are still affected by things like special browser operating modes).</p>
<p>While the ease of using <code>rem</code>s for letter-spacing might seem attractive, I hope you’ll consider Progressive Enhancement. The same older browsers you’d worry about choking on pixel scaling probably won’t have <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=rem"><code>rem</code> support</a>. Save your future self the hassle of the inevitable bug fix and use <code>em</code>s in the first place.</p>
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>Armed with the knowledge that you can gracefully and resiliently adjust letter-spacing, there’s one last thing to consider: While glyphs that are jammed too close together are obviously difficult to read, text that has been letter-spaced too far apart also has a negative impact on legibility.</p>
<p>When the distance between glyphs is too great, words start to look like individual letters. This can potentially affect a wide range of your audience, including people with dyslexia, people new to the language, people with low vision, etc.</p>
<p data-height="600" style="height: 600px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="2703a74c51ea968bfb8d860c27bebcff" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Untitled" class="codepen"><a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/2703a74c51ea968bfb8d860c27bebcff">See the Pen.</a></p>
<p>Like with the manually manipulated spacing issue discussed earlier, this issue potentially won&#8217;t be caught by an automated accessibility check. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for determining how far is too far for spacing characters apart. Since different typefaces have different character widths, it is important to take a minute to review and determine if your lines of text are both readable and legible when manipulating the letter-spacing.</p>
<h3>Use text-transform</h3>
<p>It is common to see type set in all capital letters also use letter-spacing. This is to lessen the visual “weight” of the page as a whole, so the eye isn&#8217;t unnecessarily distracted while reading through it.</p>
<p>The <code>text-transform</code> property controls how text gets capitalized. There&#8217;s a subtlety to this, in that the transform happens on the rendered page, and not in the source HTML. So, a string of text authored as, “<code>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</code>” and styled with <code>text-transform: uppercase;</code> will be rendered as “<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</span>”</p>
<p>Choosing the right amount of letter-spacing to go with text via <code>text-transform</code> is <a href="https://johndjameson.com/blog/guidelines-for-letterspacing-type/">more an art than a science</a>, and there are some hidden complexities and bad behaviors to be aware of:</p>
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re picking up on a pattern here, it&#8217;s that you want to let CSS do what it was designed to do: control the look of the page without affecting the underlying semantics of the HTML markup.</p>
<p>If you use a series of hand-typed capital letters to create the effect, it will be treated in much the same way as using typed spaces—some older screen readers will read each letter individually. While this is fine for most acronyms, content capitalized solely for the sake of aesthetics should have this transformation performed via styles.</p>
<p>And again, if this manual effort is a pattern amongst your site authors, investigate codifying the behavior and swap in <code>text-transform</code> instructions. Not only will you be doing your users a solid, but you&#8217;re also being a good coworker by saving them a little hassle and effort.</p>
<p>Reading comprehension is another factor to consider. We read written language by <a href="https://www.blog.theteamw.com/2009/12/23/100-things-you-should-know-about-people-19-its-a-myth-that-all-capital-letters-are-inherently-harder-to-read/">anticipating patterns of letters that will be in words</a>, then going back to verify. Large areas of text set in all caps makes it difficult to predict these patterns, which reduces both the speed of reading and interpretation.</p>
<h4>User experience</h4>
<p>Micro-interactions are frequently overlooked and undervalued when sprinting to get a project out the door, but go a long way in creating favorable and memorable experiences. One such micro-interaction is proper use of <code>text-transform</code>.</p>
<p>When copying text, certain browsers honor the content in the source, and ignores any text transforms applied to it. If we copied our &#8220;<code>The quick brown fox</code>&#8221; example above in Firefox or Edge and pasted it, we would see the text is not set in all uppercase.</p>
<p>Some may argue that styled presentation takes priority, but I view browsers that don&#8217;t support this preservation of author intent as being incorrect. If you do not have the time, resources, autonomy, or technical know-how to convert this text back to its authored case it becomes non-trivial to reformat. In situations where this content must be manually migrated into other systems, it unnecessarily introduces the potential for errors.</p>
<h3>Feeling fancy?</h3>
<p>Still with me? Here&#8217;s your reward! With the confidence that we&#8217;re now letter-spacing our type properly, we&#8217;re going to dig into some of the fun stuff:</p>
<h4>Special units</h4>
<p>No, we&#8217;re not talking about Seal Team 6. If you spent some time on the MDN page discussing the various units available to work with, you might have noticed a few interesting measurements in the subsection called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Font-relative_lengths">Font-relative lengths</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ex</code>, which represents the font&#8217;s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height">x-height</a>.</li>
<li><code>cap</code>, which represents the height of the font&#8217;s capital letters.</li>
<li><code>ch</code>, which represents the width of the font&#8217;s zero (<code>0</code>) glyph.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to <em>really</em> double-down on your typography, you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ex</code> for letter-spaced type set to use small caps (more on this in a bit).</li>
<li><code>cap</code> for letter-spaced type transformed to all uppercase.</li>
<li><code>ch</code> for letter-spaced <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospace fonts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the support for these units varies, <a href="https://www.lottejackson.com/learning/supports-will-change-your-life">CSS&#8217; @supports</a> allows us to confidently write these declarations while providing fallbacks for non-compliant browsers.</p>
<pre rel="CSS"><code class="language-css">.heading-primary {
  color: #4a4a4a;
  font-family: "ff-tisa-web-pro", "Tisa Pro", "FF Tisa Pro", "Georgia", serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  letter-spacing: 0.25em; /* Fallback if the `cap` unit isn't supported  */
  line-height: 1.2;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
@supports (letter-spacing: 0.25cap) {
  .heading-primary {
    letter-spacing: 0.25cap; /* Quarter the font's capital letter height */
  }
}</code></pre>
<h4>OpenType features</h4>
<p>The history of typography is full of special treatments for specific use cases where the default presentation may not have been sufficient to convey meaning effectively. Some treatments were to help reinforce visual tone, while others were more pragmatic—aiding the ease of interpretation of the text.</p>
<p data-height="600" style="height: 600px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; overflow: auto;" data-theme-id="1" data-slug-hash="d99562c697494bce18ade5b7ab798af5" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwbailey" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Untitled" class="codepen"><a href="https://codepen.io/ericwbailey/pen/d99562c697494bce18ade5b7ab798af5">See the Pen.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a> embraces this history and allows the savvy typographer to use these specialty treatments, provided <a href="https://practice.typekit.com/lesson/caring-about-opentype-features/">the font supports them</a>. For digital typography, most companies that sell professional typefaces will tell you what is available.</p>
<p>Adobe Typekit buries what features are available in the info icon located next to the &#8220;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/use-open-type-features.html">OpenType Features</a>&#8221; checkbox in their Kit Editor. <a href="http://code.thisarmy.com/fontsinfo/">Thisarmy&#8217;s Google OpenType Feature Preview</a> allows you to browse through Google Font&#8217;s library and toggle available features.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of other free font hosts do not. In order to determine if the typeface you&#8217;ve selected has the specific glyphs needed to support these features, you can test it in the browser. If you have a copy installed on your computer, you can also view the font&#8217;s character map (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Map_(Windows)">Character Map</a> for Windows, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749">Font Book</a> for Mac).</p>
<figure id="post-260628" class="align-none media-260628"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/glyphs_charactermap_letterspacing_article.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>These two programs allow you to view every glyph included in a typeface—hidden treasure awaits!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most OpenType features will automatically swap in if enabled and the specific character combinations are typed out. Thanks to some clever engineers, this substitution will not affect things like searching, translating, or pasting/changing to a font that lacks support.</p>
<p>If your font does have support for OpenType features, here are some considerations to have in mind when letter-spacing:</p>
<h4>Ligatures</h4>
<p><em>Common</em> and <em>discretionary</em> ligatures are special glyphs that combine two characters commonly found next to each other. Historically, they were used to address common kerning issues, and also to save the lead type for use elsewhere.</p>
<p>With regards to letter-spacing, you&#8217;ll want to make sure ligatures are disabled to prevent something like this from happening:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProTip?src=hash">#ProTip</a>: When using letter-spacing != 0, disable ligatures through font-feature-settings. Otherwise this happens. <a href="http://t.co/lU52wIfYx5">pic.twitter.com/lU52wIfYx5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lea Verou (@LeaVerou) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/485885496305127424">July 6, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>You might also be considering using a styled <code>span</code> tag to approximate a ligature and kern two characters closer together. This is a clever idea, but can be problematic when read by a screen reader:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axPoF3sBhcA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h4>Swashes and Alternates: Titling, contextual, stylistic, historical</h4>
<p>These special features typically adjust the presentation of the font to adjust the tone, or to make special flourishes and commonly repeated characters more distinct. These features are less common, but most professional typefaces will contain at least one treatment.</p>
<p>Much like ligatures, the presentation of letter-spaced type can affect these features. It&#8217;s good to test how it will look on a wide variety of content before pushing styles live—lorem ipsum might not catch it.</p>
<h4>Small caps</h4>
<p>A lot of word processing programs allow you to create faux <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/small-caps.html">small capitals</a> the same way they allow you to create <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/say-no-to-faux-bold">faux bold and italic styles</a>. The trouble with these faux styles is they are inferior counterfeits. Real bold, italic, and small cap styles are specifically designed to use the same proportions and metrics the rest of the typeface uses. Faux styles are a one-size-fits-all solution and are about as elegant-looking as a cow falling down the stairs.</p>
<p>While CSS does have a <code>font-variant: small-caps;</code> declaration, it really shouldn&#8217;t be used unless the font includes actual OpenType small cap glyphs. Much like word processor faux small caps, CSS-created faux small caps are a distorted photocopy of the real thing.</p>
<p>If your typeface <em>does</em> support small caps, chances are good that the typographer who designed it baked the ideal amount of letter-spacing into their glyphs. Because of this, you may not need to manually letter-space and can rely on their good judgment.</p>
<h4>Case-sensitive forms</h4>
<p>This feature renders glyphs that are designed to look good when set next to anything set in all caps. Thanks to things like hashtags (#) and at symbols (@), we&#8217;re enjoying a Renaissance of non-alphanumeric characters being placed alongside regular content. If your font supports them and you&#8217;re using letter-spaced all caps styles somewhere, I say include &#8217;em!</p>
<h4>CSS custom properties, preprocessors and utility classes</h4>
<p>One of the aims of a mature website is to have a codebase that is easy to understand and maintain. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/start-using-css-custom-properties/">CSS Custom Properties</a> and CSS preprocessors such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> or <a href="http://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a> offer features like variables that allow developers to codify things like measurements that are repeated throughout the source code.</p>
<p>For letter-spacing, variables can be a great way to ensure that developers don&#8217;t have to guesstimate what the value is. A system containing pre-defined and easy-to-understand measurements such as <code>$tracking-tight</code> / <code>$tracking-slight</code> / <code>$tracking-loose</code> let people working on the site not waste time deliberating on what best matches the design. Designers would be wise to use the same naming convention the developers do for these agreed-upon measurements.</p>
<p>Utility classes—a CSS methodology that “<a href="http://davidtheclark.com/on-utility-classes/">applies a single rule or a very simple, universal pattern</a>”—can also take advantage of this formalizing of measurements. By taking these pre-defined groupings of declarations in your design system and turning them into single-purpose classes, you can add a lot of flexibility and modularity to how elements on your site are described:</p>
<pre rel="HTML"><code class="language-markup">&lt;section class="c-card"&gt;
  &lt;h3 class="u-heading-secondary u-tracking-slight u-all-caps"&gt;
    Our services
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  …
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This can be especially handy if your organization has a large site with a lot of different components and varying levels of access to the site source code. Authors who only have access to a post authoring environment—including a HTML/Markdown view—will be more inclined to stay within established styles if they are made aware of them and they allow for the flexibility they need.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Typography is part of everyone&#8217;s reading experience, yet something that most do not think about very much. By better understanding its history, strengths, and weaknesses, we are able to craft clear and effective reading experiences for everyone.</p>
