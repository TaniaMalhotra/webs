<p>I think of grids as arrangements of rectangles with vertical and horizontal lines running through. And they are, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t still do clever things in how we place things on those grids and what we do with the elements afterwards. </p>



<p>In this demo by Jesse Breneman, a grid of hexagons is created by setting up the grid columns with math such that each block can span over three columns and two rows so that the blocks overlap in a way that allows a <code>clip-path</code> to be applied around them. This carves a block into a hexagon that is evenly spaced with the others. Very clever.</p>

<p>And, <em>ha</em>, that&#8217;s a hell of a domain name Jesse. Personally, I don&#8217;t know anything about blogging about CSS at a super cheesy domain name.</p>

<p class="explanation"><strong>Important note about accessibility:</strong> This kind of altered text will read terribly with assistive technology like VoiceOver. Just &#8220;Uhm&#8221; will read as &#8220;modified letter U, modified letter h, modified letter m,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t convey what you want at all. I try not to avoid doing something like this on a public site, even as a joke on Twitter (now that I know this). I might use it with a friend or group where I know everyone and their capabilities.</p>



<p>I had assumed that &#8220;generator&#8221; sites like this were typically hand-built by someone with an itch to scratch. Well, that second part is true, but I just noticed that the small text generator site was built on <a href="https://lingojam.com/">LingoJam</a>, which is designed to specifically help making generators like this easier. How cool!</p>

<p>When you make a new generator, you get all this power to do straight word and phrase replacements, reordering, and regex stuff. </p>



<p>I just think it&#8217;s a fun cool idea that&#8217;s all. &#x1f919;</p>

<p>As front-end developers, our job is working with browsers. Knowing how many we have and the health of them is always of great interest. As far as numbers go, we have fewer recently than we have in the past. It&#8217;s only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-windows-update-163054502.html">this month</a> that Edge is starting to auto-update browsers to the Chromium version, yet another notable milestone in the shrinking number of browsers.</p>



<span id="more-313013"></span>



<p>A few years back, Rachel Nabors <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/">likened</a> the situation to a biological ecosystem and how diversity means health:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If we lose one of those browser engines, we lose its lineage, every permutation of that engine that would follow, and the unique takes on the Web it could allow for.</p><p>And it’s not likely to be replaced.</p></blockquote>



<p>A huge consideration in all this is the open-source nature of what we have left. Remember that Microsoft&#8217;s browser technologies were <em>not</em> open-source. Brian Kardell:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In important ways, we are a&nbsp;more&nbsp;diverse, efficient and healthier ecosystem with the three multi-os, open-source engines we have left (Blink, Gecko, and WebKit) than when we had had more and were dominated by projects that weren&#8217;t that at all.</p></blockquote>



<p>As a followup Stuart Langridge <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/05/26/browsers-are-not-rendering-engines/">touches on</a> another kind of diversity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What’s really important is diversity of&nbsp;<em>influence</em>: who has the ability to make decisions which shape the web in particular ways, and do they make those decisions for good reasons or not so good?</p></blockquote>



<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that the browsers we have left will continue to evolve, perhaps even fork, and find ways to compete on anything except standards. While the current situation isn&#8217;t as bad as perhaps some folks were worried about with the loss of Microsoft&#8217;s engines (and maybe it&#8217;s even a good thing), it would certainly be bad news if we lost even more browsers [nervously glancing at Firefox], both in shrinking numbers and shrinking diversity of influence.</p>

But a job title is just <em>one</em> way the term is used. Let&#8217;s dig in a bit and apply it to the different ways people think about and use the term.</p>



<span id="more-311245"></span>



<div class="wp-block-group ticss-c360ab1e"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>People think of <span id="specific-companies">specific companies.</span></h3>



<p>I hear DX and <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> together a lot. That makes sense. Stripe is a payment gateway company almost exclusively for developers. They are serious about providing a good experience for their customers (developers), hence &#8220;developer experience.&#8221; Just listen to Suz Hinton <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/409/">talk about &#8220;friction journals&#8221;</a>, which is the idea of sitting down to use a product (like Stripe) and noting down every single little WTF moment, confusion, and frustration so that improvements can be made:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shoptalkshow-409-mp3cut.net_.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>Netlify is like Stripe in this way, as is Heroku, CodePen, and any number of companies where the <em>entire customer base</em> is developers. For companies like this, it&#8217;s almost like DX is what UX (User Experience) is for any other company. </p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group ticss-0c6f0b01"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>People think of <span id="specific-technologies">specific technologies.</span></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s common to hear DX invoked when <em>comparing</em> technologies. For instance, some people will say that Vue offers a better developer experience than React. (I&#8217;m not trying to start anything, I don&#8217;t even have much of an opinion on this.) They are talking about things like APIs. Perhaps the <strong>state</strong> is more intuitive to manage in one vs. the other. Or they are talking about features. I know Vue and Svelte have animation helpers built-in while React does not. But React has hooks and people generally like those. These are aspects of the DX of these technologies.</p>



<p>Or they might be speaking about the feeling around the tools <em>surrounding</em> the core technology. I know <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">create-react-app</a> is widely beloved, but so is the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/">Vue CLI</a>. <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">React Router</a> is hugely popular, but Vue <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">has a router</a> that is blessed (and maintained) by the core team which offers a certain feeling of trust.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<pre rel="Terminal" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">> vue create hello-world</code></pre>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<pre rel="Terminal" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">> npx create-react-app my-app</code></pre>
</div>
</div>



<p>I&#8217;m not using JavaScript frameworks/libraries as just any random example. I hear people talk about DX as it relates to JavaScript more than anything else — which could be due to the people in my circles, but it feels notable.</p>
</div></div>



<h3>People think of the world <span id="around-tech">around</span> the technology.</h3>



<p>Everybody thinks good docs are important. There is no such thing as a technology that is better than another but has much worse docs. The one with the better docs is better overall <em>because</em> it has better docs. That&#8217;s not the technology itself; that&#8217;s the world around it.</p>



<p>Have you ever seen a developer product with an API, and when you view the docs for the API while logged in, it uses API keys and data and settings <em>from your own account</em> to demonstrate? That&#8217;s extraordinary to me. That feels like DX to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JakeDohm/status/1261799440622522374">&#8220;Make the right thing easy,&#8221;</a> notes Jake Dohm. </p>



<p>That word, <em>easy</em>, feels highly related to DX. Technologies that make things easy are technologies with good DX. In usage as well as in understanding. How easily (and <a href="https://twitter.com/micahgodbolt/status/1261770428038524929">quickly</a>) can I understand what your technology does and what I can do with it? </p>



<p>What the technology <em>does</em> is often only <em id="half-story">half of the story</em>. The happy path might be great, but what happens when it breaks or errors? How is the error reporting and logging? I think of <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/">Apollo</a> and GraphQL here in my own experience. It&#8217;s such a great technology, but the error reporting feels horrendous in that it&#8217;s very difficult to track down even stuff like typos triggering errors in development. </p>



<p>What is the debugging story like? Are there special tools for it? The same goes for testing. These things are fundamental DX issues.</p>



<h3>People think of technology <span id="tech-offerings">offerings</span>.</h3>



<p>For instance, a technology might be &#8220;good&#8221; already. Say it has an API that developers like. Then it starts offering a CLI. That&#8217;s (generally) a DX improvement, because it opens up doors for developers who prefer working in that world and who build processes around it.</p>



<p>I think of things like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/">Netlify Dev</a> here. They already have this great platform and then say, here, you can run it all on your own machine too. That&#8217;s taking DX seriously.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?fit=1024%2C799&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312931" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?w=2448&amp;ssl=1 2448w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?resize=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?resize=1024%2C799&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?resize=768%2C599&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?resize=1536%2C1198&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?resize=2048%2C1598&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-15-at-6.19.11-AM.png?resize=1000%2C780&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /><figcaption>One aspect of Netlify Dev that is nice: The terminal command to start my local dev environment across all my sites on Netlify, regardless of what technology powers them, is the same: <code>netlify dev</code></figcaption></figure>



<p>Having a dedicated CLI is almost always a good DX step, assuming it is well done and maintained. I remember WordPress before <a href="https://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a>, and now lots of documentation just assumes you&#8217;re using it. I wasn&#8217;t even aware <a href="https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_cli">Cloudinary had a CLI</a> until the other day when I needed it and was pleasantly surprised that it was there. I remember when npm scripts started <a href="https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/">taking over the world</a>. (What would npm be without a CLI?) We used to have a variety of different task runners, but now it&#8217;s largely assumed a project has run commands built into the <code>package.json</code> that you use to do anything the project needs to do.</p>



<p>Melanie Sumner <a href="https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1261851049020854272">thinks of CLIs</a> immediately as core DX.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group ticss-d7589fd7"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>People think of the literal experience of <span id="coding">coding</span>.</h3>



<p>There is nothing more directly DX than the experience of typing code into code editing software and running it. That&#8217;s what &#8220;coding&#8221; is and that&#8217;s what developers do. It&#8217;s no wonder that developers take that experience seriously and are constantly trying to improve it for themselves and their teams. I think of things like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> in how it&#8217;s essentially the DX of it that has made it so dominant in the code editing space in such a short time. VS Code does all kinds of things that developers like, does them well, does them fast, and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/my-visual-studio-code-setup-extensions-and-themes/">allows for a very wide degree of customization</a>. </p>



<p>TypeScript keeps <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/03/04/redmonk-feb20.aspx">growing in popularity</a> no doubt in part due to the experience it offers within VS Code. TypeScript literally helps you code better by showing you, for example, what functions need as parameters, and making it hard to do the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Then there is the experience <em>outside</em> the editor, which in the browser itself. Years ago, I wrote <a href="https://css-tricks.com/style-injection-is-for-winners/">Style Injection is for&nbsp;Winners</a> where my point was, as a CSS developer, the experience of saving CSS code and seeing the changes instantly in the browser is a DX you definitely want to have. That concept continues to live on, growing up to JavaScript as well, where &#8220;hot reloading&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLarkInn/status/1261784047006580736">is goosebump-worthy</a>. </p>



<p>The difference between a poor developer environment (no IDE help, slow saves, manual refreshes, slow pipelines) and a great developer environment (fancy editor assistance, hot reloading, fast everything) is startling. A good developer environment, good DX, makes you a better and more productive programmer. </p>
</div></div>



<h3>People <span id="compare">compare</span> it to user experience (UX).</h3>



<p>There is <strong>a strong negative connotation</strong> to DX sometimes. It happens when people <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneHudson/status/1261782642346819588">blame it</a> for it existing <em><a href="https://twitter.com/Cennydd/status/1261797134447378433">at the cost of user experience</a></em>.</p>



<p>I think of things like client-side developer-only libraries. Think of the classic library that everyone loves to dunk: <a href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a>. Moment allows you to manipulate dates in JavaScript, and is often used client-side to do that. Users don&#8217;t care if you have a fancy API available to manipulate dates. That is entirely a developer convenience. So, you ship this library for yourself (good DX) at the cost of slowing down the website (bad UX). <em>Most</em> client-side JavaScript is in this category. </p>



<p>Equally as often, people<strong> <em>connect</em> developer experience and user experience</strong>. If developers are empowered and effective, that will &#8220;trickle down&#8221; to produce good software, the theory goes. </p>



<p>Worst case, we&#8217;re in a situation where UX and DX are on a teeter totter. Pile on some DX and UX suffers on the other side. Best case, we find ways to disentangle DX and UX entirely, finding value in both and taking both seriously. Although if one has to win, certainly it should be the users. Like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">HTML spec says</a>:</p>

<div class="wp-block-group ticss-db118f54"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h3>People think about <span id="dx-time">time</span>.</h3>



<p>How <em>long</em> does a technology take to adopt? Good DX considers this. Can I take advantage of it without rewriting everything? How quickly can I spin it up? How well does it play with other technologies I use?  What is my time investment?</p>



<p>This kind of thing makes me think of some recent experience with <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. It&#8217;s really cool technology that we don&#8217;t have time to get all into right here, but suffice to say it gives you control over a website at a high level that we often don&#8217;t think about. Like what if you could manipulate a network request before it even gets to your web server? You don&#8217;t have to use it, but because of the level it operates on, new doors open up without caring about or interfering with whatever technologies you are using. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wrangler-preview.png?fit=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312940" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wrangler-preview.png?w=1405&amp;ssl=1 1405w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wrangler-preview.png?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wrangler-preview.png?resize=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wrangler-preview.png?resize=768%2C538&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wrangler-preview.png?resize=1000%2C701&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Not only does the technology itself position itself well, the DX of using it, while there are some rough edges, is at least well-considered, providing a browser-based testing environment. </p>



<p>A powerful tool with a high investment cost, eh, that&#8217;s cool. But a powerful tool with <em>low</em> investment cost is good DX.</p>
</div></div>



<h3>People <span id="dont-think">don&#8217;t want to think</span> about it. </h3>



<p>They say the best typography goes unnoticed because all you see is the what the words are telling you, not the typography itself. That can be true of developer experience. The best DX is that you never notice the tools or the technology because they just work. </p>



<p>Good DX is just being able to <a href="https://twitter.com/jnowland/status/1261810491627696130">do your job</a> rather than fight with tools. The tools could be your developer environment, it could be build tooling, it could be hosting stuff, or it could even be whatever APIs you are interfacing with. Is the API <a href="https://twitter.com/wp_acf/status/1261787514173440000">intuitive</a> and helpful, or obtuse and tricky?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>

<p>A favorite bit&#8230;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[&#8230;] a design system doesn’t just make you think at a <strong>micro-level</strong>, but also at a <strong>macro-level</strong>, because you have to make not just decisions about pixels, but also high-level organisation decisions which the design system helps to solve. Design system work is actually <strong>diplomacy work</strong>, a lot of the time.</p><p>This is often where I see narrow, component-only tunnel vision fall short and really, these approaches are less design systems, but more <strong>component libraries</strong> that solve a much narrower cohort of problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>I like the idea of approaching CSS both from an inside-out philosophy — focusing on styling very small specific things then grouping them together to grow bigger thing — <em>and</em> from an outside-in philosophy — not forgetting that components need to be composed together sensibly.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a two-second review. If an element has an ID, you can link to it with natural browser behavior. It&#8217;s great if headings have them, because it&#8217;s often useful to link directly to a specific section of content.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;h3 id="step-2">Step 2&lt;/a></code></pre>



<p>Should I be so inclined, I could link right to this heading, be it from an URL, like <code>https://my-website.com/#step-2</code>, or an on-page link, like:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;a href="#step-2">Jump to Step 2&lt;/a></code></pre>



<p>So, it&#8217;s ideal if all headers have unique IDs. </p>



<span id="more-312635"></span>



<p>I find it entirely too much work to manually add IDs to all my headings though. For years and years, I did it like this using jQuery on this very site (sue me):</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">// Adjust this for targetting the headers important to have IDs
const $headers = $(".article-content > h3");

$headers.each((i, el) => {
  const $el = $(el);

  // Probably a flexbox layout style page
  if ($el.has("a").length != 0) {
    return;
  }

  let idToLink = "";

  if ($el.attr("id") === undefined) {
    // give it ID
    idToLink = "article-header-id-" + i;
    $el.attr("id", idToLink);
  } else {
    // already has ID
    idToLink = $el.attr("id");
  }

  const $headerLink = $("&lt;a />", {
    html: "#",
    class: "article-headline-link",
    href: "#" + idToLink
  });

  $el.addClass("has-header-link").prepend($headerLink);
});</code></pre>



<p>That script goes one step further than just adding IDs (if it doesn&#8217;t already have one) by adding a <code>#</code> link right inside the heading that links to that heading. The point of that is to demonstrate that the headers <em>have</em> IDs, and makes it easy to do stuff like right-click copy-link. <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/MWKybrQ">Here&#8217;s that demo</a>, if you care to see it.</p>



<p><strong>Problem!</strong> All the sudden this stopped working. </p>



<p>Not the script itself, that works fine. But the native browser behavior that allows the browser to jump down to the heading when the page loads is what&#8217;s busted. I imagine it&#8217;s a race condition: </p>



<ol><li>The HTML arrives</li><li>The page starts to render</li><li>The browser is looking for the ID in the URL to scroll down to</li><li>It doesn&#8217;t find it&#8230;</li><li><em>Oh wait there it is!</em></li><li>Scroll there. </li></ol>



<p>The <em>Oh wait there it is!</em> step is from the script executing and putting that ID on the heading. I really don&#8217;t blame browsers for not jumping to dynamically-inserted links. I&#8217;m surprised this worked for as long as it did. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s much better to have the IDs on the headings by the time the HTML arrives. This site is WordPress, so I knew I could do it with some kind of content filter. Turns out I didn&#8217;t even have to bother because, of course, there is a plugin for that: <a href="https://kybernaut.cz/">Karolína Vyskočilová</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-anchor-links/">Add Anchor Links</a>. Works great for me. It&#8217;s technique is that it adds the ID on the anchor link itself, which is also totally fine. I guess that&#8217;s another way of avoiding messing with existing IDs. </p>

<p>If I didn&#8217;t have WordPress, I would have found some other way to process the HTML server-side to make sure there is some kind of heading link happening somehow. There is always a way. In fact, if it was too weird or cumbersome or whatever to do during the build process or in a server-side filter, I would look at doing it in a service worker. I&#8217;ve been having fun playing with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-htmlrewriter/">Cloudflare&#8217;s HTMLRewriter</a>, which is totally capable of this.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you wanted to build a site with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> as the generator. Popular choice these days! Eleventy doesn&#8217;t have some particularly blessed way of preprocessing your CSS, if that&#8217;s something you want to do. There are a variety of ways to do it and perhaps that freedom is part of the spirit of Eleventy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve seen people set up Gulp for this, which is cool, I still use and like Gulp for some stuff. I&#8217;ve seen someone use <a href="https://dev.to/adamkdean/simple-scss-with-11ty-kmn">templating</a> to <a href="https://dev.to/adamkdean/simple-scss-with-11ty-kmn">return preprocessed CSS</a>, which seems weird, but hey, whatever works. I&#8217;ve even seen someone <a href="https://dev.to/mathieuhuot/processing-sass-with-11ty-5a09">extend the Eleventy config</a> itself to run the processing.</p>



<span id="more-312530"></span>



<p>So far, the thing that has made the most sense to me is to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/">use npm scripts</a> do the Sass processing. Do the CSS first, then the HTML, with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all">npm-run-all</a>. So, you&#8217;d set up something like this in your <code>package.json</code>:</p>



<pre rel="package.json" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm-run-all build:css build:html",
    "build:css": "node-sass src/site/_includes/css/main.scss > src/site/css/main.css",
    "build:html": "eleventy",
    "watch": "npm-run-all --parallel watch:css watch:html",
    "watch:css": "node-sass --watch src/site/_includes/css/main.scss > src/site/css/main.css",
    "watch:html": "eleventy --serve --port=8181",
    "start": "npm run watch"
  },</code></pre>



<p>I think that&#8217;s fairly nice. Since Eleventy doesn&#8217;t have a blessed CSS processing route anyway, it feels OK to have it de-coupled from Eleventy processing.</p>



<p>But I see Netlify has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/get-programmatic-control-of-your-builds-with-netlify-build-plugins/">come along nicely</a> with their build plugins. As Sarah put it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What the Build Plugin does is give you access to key points in time during that process, for instance,&nbsp;<strong><code>onPreBuild</code></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><code>onPostBuild</code></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><code>onSuccess</code></strong>, and so forth. You can execute some logic at those specific points in time</p></blockquote>



<p>There is something <em>really intuitive and nice</em> about that structure. A lot of build plugins are created by the community or Netlify themselves. You just click them on via the UI or reference them in your config. But Sass isn&#8217;t a build-in project (as I write), which I would assume is because people are a pretty opinionated about what/where/how their CSS is processed that it makes sense to just let people do it themselves. So let&#8217;s do that.</p>



<p>In our project, we&#8217;d create a directory for our plugins, and then a folder for this particular plugin we want to write:</p>



<pre rel="Project File Structure" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line="6-7"><code markup="tt">project-root/
  src/
  whatever/
  plugins/
    sass/
      index.js
      manifest.yml</code></pre>



<p>That <code>index.js</code> file is where we write our code, and we&#8217;ll specifically want to use the <code>onPreBuild</code> hook here, because we&#8217;d want our Sass to be done preprocessing <em>before</em> the build process runs Eleventy and Eleventy moves things around.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">module.exports = {
  onPreBuild: async ({ utils: { run } }) => {
    await run.command(
      "node-sass src/site/_includes/css/main.scss src/site/css/main.css"
    );
  },
};</code></pre>



<p>Here&#8217;s a looksie into all the relevant files together:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?fit=1024%2C597&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312531" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?w=2928&amp;ssl=1 2928w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?resize=1024%2C597&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?resize=1536%2C896&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?resize=2048%2C1195&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.47.36-AM.png?resize=1000%2C583&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Now, if I <code>netlify build</code> from the command line, it will run the same build process that Netlify itself does, and it will hook into my plugin and run it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?fit=1024%2C999&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312532" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?w=1634&amp;ssl=1 1634w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?resize=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?resize=1024%2C999&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?resize=768%2C749&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?resize=1536%2C1498&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-6.51.27-AM.png?resize=1000%2C976&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>One little thing I noticed is that I was trying to have my config be the (newer) <code>netlify.yml</code> format, but the plugins didn&#8217;t work, and I had to re-do the config as <code>netlify.toml</code>. </p>



<p>So we de-coupled ourselves from Eleventy with this particular processing, and coupled ourselves to Netlify. Just something to be aware of. I&#8217;m down with that as this way of configuring a build is so nice and I see so much potential in it. </p>



<p>I prefer the more explicit and broken up configuration of this style. Just look at how much cleaner the <code>package.json</code> gets:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-7.03.51-AM.png?fit=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1" alt="Removed a bunch of lines from the scripts area of a package.json file, like the specific build:css and build:html commands" class="wp-image-312534" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-7.03.51-AM.png?w=1424&amp;ssl=1 1424w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-7.03.51-AM.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-7.03.51-AM.png?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-7.03.51-AM.png?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-09-at-7.03.51-AM.png?resize=1000%2C605&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<h3>I still have this idea&#8230;</h3>



<p>&#8230;of building a site that is a dog-fooded example of all the stuff you could/should do during a build process. <a href="https://build-process.netlify.app/">I&#8217;ve started the site here</a>, (<a href="https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/build-process">and repo</a>), but it&#8217;s not doing too much yet. I think it would be cool to wire up everything on that list (and more?) via Build Plugins. </p>



<p>If you wanna contribute, feel free to let me know. Maybe email me or open an issue to talk about what you&#8217;d want to do. You&#8217;re free to do a Pull Request too, but PRs without any prior communication are a little tricky sometimes as it&#8217;s harder to ensure our visions are aligned before you put in a bunch of effort.</p>
