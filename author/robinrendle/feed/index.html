<p>Here’s a fantastic case study where Ivan Akulov looks at the rather popular writing app Notion and how the team might improve the performance in a variety of ways; through code splitting, removing unused vendor code, module concatenation, and deferring JavaScript execution. Not so long ago, we made a list for <a href="https://css-tricks.com/web-performance-checklist/">getting started with web performance</a> but this article goes so much further into the app side of things: making sure that users are loading only the JavaScript that they need, and doing that as quickly as possible.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?fit=1024%2C674&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312409" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?resize=1024%2C674&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?resize=1536%2C1011&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/notion.png?resize=1000%2C658&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>I love that this piece just doesn’t feel like dunking on the Notion team, and bragging about how Ivan might do things better. There&#8217;s always room for improvement and constructive feedback is better than guilting someone into it. Yay for making things fast while being nice about it!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a series of questions I’ve struggled with for as long as I can remember. The questions have to do with design systems work: Where should we document things? Do we make a separate app? Do we use a third-party tool to document our components? How should that tie into Figma or Sketch? What about written documentation? Should we invest a lot of time into making a giant Polaris-like wiki of how to build things?</p>



<p>The issue with all these tools and links and repositories is that it can become increasingly difficult to remember where to go for what kind of information. Designers should go <em>here</em> and engineers should go <em>there</em> — unless, of course, you’re an iOS engineer, then you need <em>this</em> special resource instead. It can be overwhelming and confusing for everyone that doesn’t live within the orbit of design systems drama and is just trying to ship a feature on time.</p>



<span id="more-312049"></span>



<p>After years of struggling with these questions, I think my current advice to my past (and current) self is this: <em>meet the people where they are</em>. And where are most people asking questions about design systems, whether that’s a color variable or a component or a design pattern?</p>



<p>In Slack! </p>



<p>The other day I thought it would be neat to set up some <a href="https://slackhq.com/mind-the-bot-a-guide-to-slackbot-custom-responses">Slackbot custom responses</a> to do a rather simple thing. When someone types <code>color me</code> into a channel, I all the color variables and their hex values are pasted. That way, no one needs to learn a new tool or bookmark <em>yet another link</em>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>



<p>We first have to open up the settings of the organization you’re in and click the &#8220;Customize&#8221;  item in this dropdown:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.16.57-AM.png?fit=510%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312050" width="270" height="542" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.16.57-AM.png?w=632&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.16.57-AM.png?resize=150%2C300&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.16.57-AM.png?resize=510%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 510w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>That pops open a new tab with the &#8220;Customize your Workspace&#8221; settings. If you select &#8220;Slackbot&#8221; from the options, then you can then see all of the custom responses that have been set up already. From there, we can create a new response like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?fit=1024%2C430&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312051" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?w=2078&amp;ssl=1 2078w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?resize=1024%2C430&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?resize=768%2C322&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?resize=1536%2C645&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?resize=2048%2C859&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.19.48-AM.png?resize=1000%2C420&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>That <code>\n</code> is what breaks things onto a new line so that I can now test it out in a chat with myself once I’ve saved this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?fit=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-312052" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?w=1604&amp;ssl=1 1604w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=1536%2C1097&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-30-at-10.21.59-AM.png?resize=1000%2C714&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Because this takes up so much darn space, I also made separate answers for each color, like <code>blue</code> and <code>purple.</code> But all of this has me wondering: how else can we use Slack — or whatever chat app or communication tool — to extend the cause of good design systems work?</p>



<p>I bet there’s a ton of other things we can do to improve our lives within tools like this and make design systems work even easier.</p>

<span id="more-311924"></span>



<p>These are plugins that run whenever your site is building. One example is the A11y plugin that will fail a build if accessibility failures are detected. Another minifies HTML and there&#8217;s even one that inlines critical CSS. What’s exciting is that these build plugins are kinda making complex Gulp/Grunt environments the stuff of legend. Instead of going through the hassle of config stuff, build plugins let Netlify figure it all out for you. And that’s pretty neat.</p>



<p>Also, our very own Sarah Drasner wrote just about <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/10/16/creating-and-using-your-first-netlify-build-plugin/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=bp-release-tzm&amp;utm_campaign=devex">how to create your first Netlify Build Plugin</a>. So, if you have an idea for something that you could share with the community, then that may be the best place to start.</p>

<p>I have to say that I <em>love</em> how the UI feels in Framer — both on the website and the design app itself. It all reminds me of the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/">Oculus Quest</a> UI with rounded corners and dark-mode inspired elements. I know it’s probably just a silly trend, but I like it!</p>



<p>Anyway, I’ve yet to dig into this fancy new tool too much but the animation effects appear to be quite magic and absolutely worth experimenting with. </p>

<p>We mentioned a way to make a CSS-only carousel in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/newsletters/">a recent issue of the  newsletter</a> and I thought that a more detailed write up would be interesting and capture some of my thoughts on making one.</p>



<span id="more-306971"></span>



<p>So, here’s what we’re making today:</p>



<figure><video src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fancy-carousel-1.mp4" autoplay="true" autostart="true" loop="true" controls=""></video></figure>



<p>There’s no JavaScript here, whatsoever! No jQuery plugins. No trickiness. Just a couple of new-ish CSS properties that I’ve been experimenting with as well as some basic HTML.</p>



<p>OK to start, we need to focus on the markup. The design includes a left navigation made up of images and a large image gallery on the right that lets us scroll through each image individually. We’ll also need a wrapper to help us organize the layout:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="wrapper">
  &lt;nav class="lil-nav">&lt;/nav>
  &lt;div class="gallery">&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></code></pre>



<p>Next, we can add images! For this little example, I checked out our list of sites with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sites-with-high-quality-photos-you-can-use-for-free/">high quality images that you can use for free</a> and went with <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.</p>



<p>After saving images with the CodePen asset manager, I started adding the URLs to the <code>nav</code> element:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;nav class="lil-nav">
  &lt;a href="#image-1">
    &lt;img class="lil-nav__img" src="..." alt="Yosemite" />
  &lt;/a>
  &lt;a href="#image-2">
    &lt;img class="lil-nav__img" src="..." alt="Basketball hoop" />
  &lt;/a>
  &lt;!-- more images go here --> 
&lt;/nav></code></pre>



<p>See that the <code>href</code> to each of these links is pointing to an ID? That’s because if we look at the demo again, we want to be able to click an image and then we want to it to hop to the larger version of that image in the gallery to the right.</p>



<p>So, now we can start to add these images to the large gallery, too…</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="gallery">
  &lt;img class="gallery__img" id="image-1" src="..." alt="Yosemite" />
  &lt;img class="gallery__img" id="image-2" src="..." alt="Basketball hoop" />
  &lt;!-- more images go here --> 
&lt;/div></code></pre>



<p>Nifty. Next is the fun part: styling this bad boy. We can use a grid layout the parent <code>.wrapper</code> and set some smart defaults for the <code>img</code> element:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">img {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}

.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr;
  grid-gap: 20px;
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_bGVpeeE" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/bGVpeeE?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=bGVpeeE&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed bGVpeeE" title="CodePen Embed bGVpeeE" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>So far, we have our layout sorted and our links set up. Next, let&#8217;s account for overflow that might spill outside our wrapper and make sure that the nav and the gallery are scrollable:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="5, 6"><code markup="tt">.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  height: 100vh; 
}

.gallery {
  overflow: scroll;
}

.lil-nav {
  overflow-y: scroll;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_GRpZjVQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/GRpZjVQ?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GRpZjVQ&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed GRpZjVQ" title="CodePen Embed GRpZjVQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>We can scroll through each image in the gallery now, but if this was a production website we’d probably want to make sure that folks can scroll passed this carousel a bit more easily. <a href="https://trentwalton.com/2013/04/11/responsive-maps/">Trent Walton wrote about</a> this very problem several years ago and I think it’s always worth keeping in mind.</p>



<p>Next up, let’s focus on the carousel snap of each image in the gallery. To do that we’ll need to use the <code>scroll-snap-type</code> and <code>scroll-snap-align</code> property like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.gallery {
  overflow: scroll;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}

.gallery__img {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}</code></pre>



<p>Now try scrolling through the gallery on the right-hand side again:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_jObqVRW" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/jObqVRW?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=jObqVRW&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed jObqVRW" title="CodePen Embed jObqVRW" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>If you want to learn more about these properties I’d highly recommend this piece about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/">practical CSS scroll snapping</a> which digs into the nitty-gritty of these properties.</p>



<p>We have a pretty dang usable carousel! From here, all we have to do is tidy up the design because the gallery image isn’t the full height of the screen. To do that we can use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/"><code>object-fit</code></a> and give each image a <code>min-height</code> with the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/"><code>vh</code></a> unit, just like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.gallery__img {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  min-height: 100vh;
  object-fit: cover;
}</code></pre>



<p>Now the big gallery images will always be the full size of the screen and will scale to take up the width and height. Let’s move on and tackle the style of the little navigation images:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.lil-nav {
  overflow-y: scroll;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}

.lil-nav a {
  height: 200px;
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.lil-nav__img {
  object-fit: cover;
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_bGVpgqp" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/bGVpgqp?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=bGVpgqp&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed bGVpgqp" title="CodePen Embed bGVpgqp" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>At first, I made this little nav act like a carousel too, but it felt really weird. I’m just keeping the default <code>scroll</code> behavior for now. In that demo above, though, try clicking an image. Notice how it jumps to that image in the carousel immediately? It would be nice if we could animate that transition a bit — and we can!</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="4"><code markup="tt">.gallery {
  overflow: scroll;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}</code></pre>



<p>That <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/scroll-behavior/"><code>scroll-behavior</code></a> CSS property is super handy for this and so now the whole thing will animate if you click one of the nav items:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_yLYOgPz" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/yLYOgPz?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yLYOgPz&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed yLYOgPz" title="CodePen Embed yLYOgPz" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Nifty, eh? One more tiny thing we could do here is throw a filter on the nav items to make them black and white and then animate them on hover:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.lil-nav__img {
  object-fit: cover;
  filter: saturate(0);
  transition: 0.3s ease all;
}

.lil-nav__img:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  filter: saturate(1);
}</code></pre>



<p>I’m sure there’s a lot more we could do here but I think this works quite nicely!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_eYpZgrM" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/eYpZgrM?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=eYpZgrM&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed eYpZgrM" title="CodePen Embed eYpZgrM" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>We could even throw a tiny bit of JavaScript into the mix to show which image is active, but I reckon that folks know that just from looking at the gallery.</p>



<p>That’s it! We now have a carousel that’s pretty dang good for progressive enhancement and it means we don’t have to load a library of JavaScript or write a bunch more code than we really need to.</p>



<h3>Making the carousel responsive…</h3>



<p>Let’s go one step further though and make this chap responsive. What we want to do is reverse the order of our grid by moving all of our current styles into a media query that is only activated at larger screens.</p>



<p>You might want to open up this demo in a new tab and decrease/increase the size of the browser to see the changes take place:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_YzyqNJK" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/YzyqNJK?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=YzyqNJK&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed YzyqNJK" title="CodePen Embed YzyqNJK" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>If you load this demo on a mobile device you should see how the layout switches between the two modes. This is done by using a single media query on the <code>.wrapper</code> element. Note that we’re using Sass:</p>



<pre rel="SCSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss" data-line=""><code markup="tt">$large: 1200px;

.wrapper {
  overflow: hidden;
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 10px;

  @media screen and (min-width: $large) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>Let&#8217;s add one on the navigation, too. But this time, we need to tell the navigation to start on the second row so it moves to the bottom of the screen:</p>



<pre rel="SCSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.lil-nav {
  overflow-x: scroll;
  overflow-y: hidden;
  display: flex;
  grid-row-start: 2;

  @media screen and (min-width: $large) {
    overflow-y: scroll;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    display: block;
    grid-row-start: auto;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>With the gallery we need to switch around the <code>scroll-type</code> for larger screens and reverse the <code>overflow</code> property as well:</p>



<pre rel="SCSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.gallery {
  overflow-x: scroll;
  overflow-y: hidden;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  display: flex;

  @media screen and (min-width: $large) {
    display: block;
    overflow-y: scroll;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s the bulk of the changes we’ve had to make and I quite like it! If we wanted to make this production-ready, we would think about accessibility (e.g. we probably don’t want screen readers to read out all the images in both the nav <em>and</em> gallery). Then there&#8217;s performance — we might consider lazy-loading so the images are only rendered when they&#8217;re needed.</p>



<p>Either way, this is a good start !</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Not so long ago, we wrote about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/dark-modes-with-css/">dark mode in CSS</a> and I’ve been thinking about how white text on a black background is pretty much always harder to read than black text on a white background. After thinking about this for a while, I realized that we can fix that problem by making the text thinner in dark mode using variable fonts!</p>



<span id="more-306566"></span>



<p>Here’s an example of the problem where I’m using the typeface <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz?vfonly&amp;selection.family=Yanone+Kaffeesatz:wght@453;469&amp;sidebar.open">Yanone Kaffeesatz</a> from Google Fonts. Notice that the section with white text on a black background looks heavier than the section with black text on a white background.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_wvKwoQX" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/wvKwoQX?height=500&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=wvKwoQX&amp;default-tab=result" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed wvKwoQX" title="CodePen Embed wvKwoQX" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Oddly enough, these two bits of text are actually using the same <code>font-weight</code> value of <code>400</code>. But to my eye, the white text looks extra bold on a black background.</p>



<p>Stare at this example for a while. This is just how white text looks on a darker background; it’s how our eyes perceive shapes and color. And this might not be a big issue in some cases but reading light text on a dark background is always way more difficult for readers. And if we don’t take care designing text in a dark mode context, then it can feel as if the text is vibrating as we read it.</p>



<p>How do we fix this? </p>



<p>Well, this is where variable fonts come in! We can use a lighter font weight to make the text easier to read whenever dark mode is active:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  font-weight: 400;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    font-weight: 350;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>Here’s how that looks with this new example: </p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_oNjvBpp" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/oNjvBpp?height=500&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=oNjvBpp&amp;default-tab=result" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed oNjvBpp" title="CodePen Embed oNjvBpp" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>This is better! The two variants now look a lot more balanced to me.</p>



<p>Again, it’s only a small difference, but all great designs consist of micro adjustments like this. And I reckon that, if you’re already using variable fonts and loading all these weights, then you should definitely adjust the text so it’s easier to read.</p>



<p>This effect is easier to spot if we compare the differences between longer paragraphs of text. Here we go, this time in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata?vfonly&amp;selection.family=Literata:wght@400;562;700&amp;sidebar.open">Literata</a>: </p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_wvKvmVZ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/wvKvmVZ?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=wvKvmVZ&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed wvKvmVZ" title="CodePen Embed wvKvmVZ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Notice that the text on the right <em>feels</em> bolder, but it just isn’t. It’s simply an optical allusion — both examples above have a font-weight of 500. </p>



<p>So to fix this issue we can do the same as the example above:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  font-weight: 500;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    font-weight: 400;
  }
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_zYvOymL" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/zYvOymL?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=zYvOymL&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed zYvOymL" title="CodePen Embed zYvOymL" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Again, it’s a slight change but it’s important because at these sizes every typographic improvement we make helps the reading experience.</p>



<h3>Oh and here’s a quick Google fonts tip!</h3>



<p>Google Fonts lets you add a font to your website by adding a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document, like this: </p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;head>
  &lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rosario:wght@515&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> 
&lt;/head></code></pre>



<p>That&#8217;s using the Rosario typeface and adding a font-weight of <code>515</code> — that’s the bit in the code above that says <code>wght@515</code>. Even if this happens to be a variable font, only this font weight will be downloaded. If we try to do something like this though&#8230;</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">body {
  font-weight: 400;
}</code></pre>



<p>&#8230;nothing will happen! In fact, the font won’t load at all. Instead, we need to declare which range of font-weight values we want by doing the following:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Yanone+Kaffeesatz:wght@300..500&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"></code></pre>



<p>This <code>@300..500</code> bit in the code above is what tells Google Fonts to download a font file with all the weights between <code>300</code> and <code>500</code>. Alternatively, adding a <code>;</code> between each weight will then only download weights <code>300</code> and <code>500</code> – so, for example, you can’t pick weight <code>301</code>:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Yanone+Kaffeesatz:wght@300;500&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"></code></pre>



<p>It took me a few minutes to figure out what was going wrong and why the font wasn’t loading at all, so hopefully the Google Fonts team can make that a bit clearer with the embed codes in the future. Perhaps there should be an option or a toggle somewhere to select a range or specific weights (or maybe I just didn’t see it).</p>



<p>Either way, I think all this is why variable fonts can be so gosh darn helpful; they allow us to adjust text in ways that we’ve never been able to do before. So, yay for variable fonts!</p>

<p>Between each post of <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer’s blog</a> there’s this rather lovely illustration that can randomly be one of these five options:</p>

<span id="more-306866"></span>



<p>Eric made each illustration into a separate background image then switches out that image with the <code>nth-of-type</code> CSS property, like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.entry:nth-of-type(2n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-1.png);
}

.entry:nth-of-type(3n+1)::before {

.entry:nth-of-type(4n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-3.png);
}

.entry:nth-of-type(5n+1)::before {
   background-image: url(image-4.png);
}</code></pre>



<p>This seems like a good time to plug our very own little <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/nth-child-tester/">:nth Tester</a> tool. It definitely helps me understand what something like <code>(2n+1)</code> means in English. You can type in any string you like and see what effect that has on your site:</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2020/04/15/pseudo-randomly-adding-illustrations-with-css/">back to Eric’s post</a>. As he mentions, his technique is <em>pseudo-random</em> in that it looks like a random image on the page but it technically isn’t. Either way, I think it’s a really lovely technique! And it certainly breaks up the visual monotony that happens when you’re looking at a website for too long.</p>



<p>Here’s what it looks like in practice:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?fit=1024%2C554&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306869" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?w=2476&amp;ssl=1 2476w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?resize=1024%2C554&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?resize=768%2C416&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?resize=1536%2C831&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?resize=2048%2C1108&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-15-at-11.44.57-AM.png?resize=1000%2C541&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Lovely stuff!</p>



<p>Another way to do this is to use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/random-numbers-css/">random numbers in CSS</a>. For example, we could set a variable in JavaScript and then apply it with CSS custom properties. Or we could put all the images in a single sprite file and change the <code>background-position</code> based on a random number.</p>



<p>This is definitely one of those things in CSS where there are no wrong answers; just different ways to do the same awesome thing!</p>

<p>Chase McCoy wrote a nifty post about the <a class="ek-link" href="https://chasem.co/2020/04/gap-problem">“gap problem”</a> when making a grid of items. His argument might be summarized like this: how should we space elements with margins in CSS? He notes that the <code>gap</code> property isn’t quite ready for prime time when it comes to using it with flexbox, like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="3"><code markup="tt">.grid {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
}</code></pre>



<span id="more-306249"></span>



<p>Right now, using <code>gap</code> with flexbox is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox-gap">only supported in Firefox</a> and I’ve already caught myself forgetting about that in a few projects. So watch out for that.</p>



<p>Anyway, the part about Chase’s blog post that I <em>love</em> is where he mentions Andy Bell’s technique for creating <a href="https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-responsive-grid-layout-with-no-media-queries-using-css-grid/">a responsive layout with no media queries</a>, like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 10px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr));
}</code></pre>



<p>This CSS is doing the following: </p>



<ul><li>Make a grid with a 10px gap between each column and row.</li><li>Each column should have a minimum width (150px).</li><li>Each column should also be equal width (1fr).</li><li>The grid should <a href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/">auto-fill</a> as many columns that can fit.</li></ul>



<p>The nifty thing about all this is that our grid is now effectively responsive because of <code>minmax</code> — if you resize the browser, then the grid will snap down into fewer columns, <a class="ek-link" href="https://codepen.io/robinrendle/pen/rNVgKmx">just like this</a>:</p>



<figure><video src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/responsive-grid.mp4" autoplay="true" autostart="true" loop="true" controls=""></video></figure>



<p>No media queries at all! Although sure, there’s a few other ways that you could get this to work but I think this is neat not just because we’re avoiding media queries — instead, it’s because it teaches us to think in a new way when designing and building components. </p>



<p>Chase continues:  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With this technique, instead of using breakpoints to specify the screen size where your items should stack, you specify the minimum size an element should be before it stacks. I like this because it encourages developers to think about responsive design in terms of behaviors instead of screen sizes.</p></blockquote>



<p>“Behaviors instead of screen sizes” is such a great way to think about component design! A lot of the problems I’ve encountered when making components for a design system is when I’ve been thinking about screen sizes — mobile, tablet, desktop, etc. — and trying to make those components fit within those constraints. </p>

<p>Thinking in behaviors is <em>always</em> more effective because there are so many things that can impact a component beyond what screen or device width we&#8217;re working with. Perhaps we want that component to fit inside another component. Or we want to align some helper text to the side of it for comparison.</p>



<p>Either way, thinking about behaviors instead of screen sizes isn’t really going to be fully possible until we have <a href="https://css-tricks.com/lets-not-forget-about-container-queries/">container queries</a>, as Chris writes: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Container queries are always on the top of the list of requested improvements to CSS. The general sentiment is that if we had container queries, we wouldn’t write as many global media queries based on page size. That’s because we’re actually trying to control a more scoped container, and the only reason we use media queries for that now is because it’s the best tool we have in CSS. I absolutely believe that. </p></blockquote>

<p>What a neat idea! Justin’s design reminds me of the way that Instapaper treated inline footnotes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/instapaper-footnotes.png?ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-305947" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/instapaper-footnotes.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/instapaper-footnotes.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Instapaper (circa 2012)</figcaption></figure>



<p>I guess the reason I like this idea so much is that a lot of comments don’t need to be read constantly, — they’re sort of a reminder that, “Hey, this needs work in the future” or “Yikes, this is weird and I’m sorry.” Keeping these comments out of the code makes it much easier to scan the whole file, too. </p>



<p>I do wonder if there could be a toggle that shows every comment, just in case you need to read all the comments in sequence rather than clicking to toggle each one.</p>



<p>Anyway, all this talk about comments reminds me of an absolutely fantastic talk by Sarah Drasner at JSConf this year where she discussed why comments are so dang hard to get right:</p>
