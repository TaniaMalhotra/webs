Anyway, the two alternatives are great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also important to note is that Local by Flywheel is &lt;strong&gt;completely FREE&lt;/strong&gt;! And that they&#039;ve got a great community forum/discourse where you can ask and expect a quick reply.

The community forums&#039; vibe is really good.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  But it&#039;s important to note as well that this is WordPress only.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Hi, have you tried all in one word migration with local flywheel, I couldn&#039;t get it to activate after installing it?

There are no files at all with WP DB Migrate Pro, it just communicates directly between local &#038; production (or any two sites, really) and does its thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris, you mentioned using WP Migrate DB Pro. What is it that you enjoy about it? Have you tried the All In One Migration plugin? It exports your entire site into a single file for upload. Database, files, everything! You need to pay for the unlimited extension for large sites, but it&#039;s a one off fee.

					<description><![CDATA[Ever since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-local-wordpress-development/&quot;&gt;the poll article&lt;/a&gt;, I had the (mis)fortune of moving to a new development machine. When I did, I decided to give Local a whirl, as it looked pretty good at that time, and I was looking into other setups.

I really think it has helped me a lot in my local development workflow versus my old setup (MAMP Pro). Since I do development on OSX and Windows (crazy, right?), I actually liked that I could use the same program in both places in the same way. And for free too! It has really sped things up for me as well by setting the WP install defaults and then doing a pull down of a site with WP DB Migrate Pro. I can pretty much be up and running with a site in a few minutes. QA likes that I can send them &quot;preview&quot; links of issues we&#039;re fixing, and I like that it is easier to debug on mobile &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my VMs.

I&#039;m thinking I may recommend our whole dev team be on it, but we&#039;ll see. I&#039;ve already seen a few updates for the program since I got it, so it seems like they&#039;re continuing to improve it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Chris, awesome suggestion, thanks so much for posting!  From playing around with it this morning I can already tell it will save me tons of time and I&#039;m sure it will get even better.

One snag I ran into was getting the external server address to work on Codekit - were there any extra steps you ran besides what you showed in the article above?  I turned on &#039;External Server Required&#039; and added my .dev address from Local, but the Codekit preview icon still links out to the Bonjour address.  The .dev address works, but Codekit doesn&#039;t auto-refresh it.

Just curious if you did something else that I didn&#039;t pick up on!]]></description>
