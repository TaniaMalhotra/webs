					<description><![CDATA[In Chrome if you move fast between images and then unhover you can see this bug: https://imgur.com/a/QO6NdGq

To fix it add property: &lt;code&gt;transform: scale(1);&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.item { }&lt;/code&gt;.

Should look like this:

&lt;code&gt;.item {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  flex: 1 1 0px;
  transition: transform 500ms;
  transform: scale(1);
}&lt;/code&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! This is really great. Thank you for sharing this. I actually tried this and added in my images from a folder but somehow it&#039;s not working. Can you tell me what are the possible reasons why the hover function won&#039;t work? Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this cool demo Chris. I was able to use this and add slider animation to it to show more items on click. Thank you for the inspiration :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you may have noticed, Netflix recently (and I use the term loosely) started playing a sample of the video when you hover over it.  I&#039;m not asking for an exact replica of how that&#039;s done, I&#039;m just wondering if  that&#039;s something achievable with pure CSS/HTML5 or would you likely need to get some JS involved?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice. I noticed two things though and I wonder if/how they can be fixed:


When scaling the element (but not translating the siblings), if you quickly hover over an adjacent sibing it will sort of &quot;glitch&quot; with it, fighting to be rendered on top. Can this maybe be fixed with z-index?
When scaling and translating, if you quickly span the cursor over the elements, some white space will briefly form between them. Maybe the transition-duration has to be adjusted in a specific way between translate and scale?

Hey Sheila - I believe that your issue is related to overflow. If I replace your overflow settings on the .previewScroller container (both x and y) with a basic &#039;overflow: visible&#039; then the images do expand outside the container. You may need to tweak things further to work with the scrollable container though.

Very cool implementation by the way!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great example of why you need depth of knowledge of CSS.  This comes out being several orders of magnitude faster to implement than Javascript.  Nicely reasoned and written; I come here specifically to see how people think their way through design problems and this is a wonderful example.]]></description>
