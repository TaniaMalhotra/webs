python also has beautiful ideals but the syntax is so bad it&#039;s a joke
ruby isn&#039;t much better from what I&#039;ve seen actually]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity. In other words costs or difficulties to the user should be given more weight than costs to authors; which in turn should be given more weight than costs to implementors&quot;

this should apply to every product that aims to be good

users feed you, make them happy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People compare it to user experience

hierarchy is fine, but something&#039;s still wrong.. (w3c)

from my experience:
- users usually don&#039;t even know who is the author
- authors usually hide behind &quot;we&quot;, &quot;community&quot;, team etc.
- browser implementors don&#039;t listen to authors
- spec makers don&#039;t bother to check if the implementor listens to authors

because all of that:
- app authors listen to implementors in the first place

so, you get DX over UX
my point is that hierarchy should be followed and controlled by it&#039;s members for the better world..]]></description>
