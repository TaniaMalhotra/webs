<p>As front-end developers, our job is working with browsers. Knowing how many we have and the health of them is always of great interest. As far as numbers go, we have fewer recently than we have in the past. It&#8217;s only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-windows-update-163054502.html">this month</a> that Edge is starting to auto-update browsers to the Chromium version, yet another notable milestone in the shrinking number of browsers.</p>



<span id="more-313013"></span>



<p>A few years back, Rachel Nabors <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/">likened</a> the situation to a biological ecosystem and how diversity means health:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If we lose one of those browser engines, we lose its lineage, every permutation of that engine that would follow, and the unique takes on the Web it could allow for.</p><p>And it’s not likely to be replaced.</p></blockquote>



<p>A huge consideration in all this is the open-source nature of what we have left. Remember that Microsoft&#8217;s browser technologies were <em>not</em> open-source. Brian Kardell:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In important ways, we are a&nbsp;more&nbsp;diverse, efficient and healthier ecosystem with the three multi-os, open-source engines we have left (Blink, Gecko, and WebKit) than when we had had more and were dominated by projects that weren&#8217;t that at all.</p></blockquote>



<p>As a followup Stuart Langridge <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/05/26/browsers-are-not-rendering-engines/">touches on</a> another kind of diversity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What’s really important is diversity of&nbsp;<em>influence</em>: who has the ability to make decisions which shape the web in particular ways, and do they make those decisions for good reasons or not so good?</p></blockquote>



<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that the browsers we have left will continue to evolve, perhaps even fork, and find ways to compete on anything except standards. While the current situation isn&#8217;t as bad as perhaps some folks were worried about with the loss of Microsoft&#8217;s engines (and maybe it&#8217;s even a good thing), it would certainly be bad news if we lost even more browsers [nervously glancing at Firefox], both in shrinking numbers and shrinking diversity of influence.</p>

<p>Just look at <a href="https://github.com/luruke/browser-2020">Luigi De Rosa&#8217;s list here</a>. I&#8217;d bet a lot of you didn&#8217;t know the browser could do all that stuff &mdash; push notifications! Native sharing menus! Picture-in-picture!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mostly JavaScript stuff and a little CSS. Notably absent: anything in HTML.</p>

<p>I agree that these things are mega important.</p>
<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] the real gold for marketers is from word-of-mouth discussions. Those conversations with your friends when you recommend a TV show, a brand of clothing, or share a news report. This is the most valuable kind of marketing.</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of how tools, like <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast&#8217;s <abbr>SEO</abbr> plugin for WordPress</a>, help with managing the look/content of social preview cards.</p>
<figure id="post-300856" class="align-none media-300856"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/social-preivew.png?resize=1994%2C1226&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1994" height="1226"  data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>I could see value in this same kind thing where it shows Slack and WhatsApp and all those tools, even if it&#8217;s harder to control.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth making this clear then. On iOS, the only browser engine is WebKit. There are other browsers, but they can&#8217;t bring their own engine (Blink/Gecko).

<p>It&#8217;s worth making this clear then. On iOS, the only browser engine is WebKit. There are other browsers, but they can&#8217;t bring their own engine (Blink/Gecko). So, if you&#8217;re using Chrome or Firefox on iOS, it&#8217;s really the same engine Safari is using, only slightly less capable (e.g. no third-party content blocker apps work in them). </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth knowing that as a developer. While Chrome supports stuff like service workers on their desktop browser and on other platforms, the browser engine made available to non-Safari browsers on iOS does not. You don&#8217;t have them there. Likewise for Firefox.</p>

Same deal with Edge <a href="https://css-tricks.com/edges-announcements/">when it also went Chrome</a> earlier this year. Mike Taylor called these changes a <a href="https://twitter.com/viewsourceconf/status/1173978503638700032">&#8220;Decreasingly Diverse Browser Engine World&#8221;</a> in a talk I&#8217;d like to see. </p>
<p>So all we&#8217;ve got left is Chrome-stuff, Firefox-stuff, and Safari-stuff. Chrome and Safari share the same lineage but have diverged enough, evolve separately enough, and are walled away from each other enough that it makes sense to think of them as different from one another.</p>
<p><span id="more-296122"></span></p>
<p>I know there are fancier words to articulate this. For example, browser engines themselves have names that are distinct and separate from the names of the browsers. </p>
<p>Take Chrome, which is based on the open-source project Chromium, which uses the rendering engine Blink and the JavaScript engine <abbr>V8</abbr>.</p>
<p>Firefox uses Gecko as its browser engine, which is turning into Quantum, which has sub-parts like Servo for CSS and rendering.</p>
<p>Safari uses WebKit as a browser engine, which has parts like WebCore and JavaScriptCore.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all kinda complicated and I&#8217;m not even sure I quite understand it all. My brain just thinks of it as everything under the umbrella of the main browser name.</p>
<p>The two extremes of looking at this from the perspective of decreasing diversity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is bad.</strong> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/">Decreased diversity</a> may hinder ecosystems from competing and innovating.</li>
<li><strong>This is good.</strong> Cross-engine problems are a major productivity loss for the world. Getting down to one ecosystem would be even better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever it is, the ship has sailed. All we can do is look forward. </p>
<p>Random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps diversity has just moved scope. Rather than the browser engines themselves representing diversity, maybe <em>forks</em> of the engnies we have left can compete against each other. Maybe starting from a strong foundation is a good place to start innovating?</li>
<li>If, god forbid, we got down to one browser engine, what happens to the web standards process? The fear would be that the last-engine-standing doesn&#8217;t have to worry about interop anymore and they run wild with implementations. But does running wild mean the playing field can never be competitive again?</li>
<li>It&#8217;s awesome when browsers compete on features that are great for users but don&#8217;t affect web standards. Great password managers, user protection features, clever bookmarking ideas, reader modes, clean integrations with payment APIs, free VPNs, etc. That was <a href="https://www.opera.com">Opera&#8217;s</a> play, and now we see many more in the same vein. <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> is all about customization, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> doubles down on privacy and security, and <a href="https://www.pumabrowser.com">Puma</a> is about monetization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brian Kardell wrote about some of this stuff recently in his &#8220;<a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Beyond.html">Beyond Browser Vendors</a>&#8221; post. An interesting point is that the remaining browser engines are all open source. That means they can and do take outside contributions, which is exactly how CSS Grid came to exist. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the work on CSS Grid in both WebKit and Chromium (Blink) was done, not by Google or Apple, but by teams at Igalia.</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute: The prioritization of its work was determined in 2 browsers not by a vendor, but by an investment from Bloomberg who had the foresight to fund this largely uncontroversial work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, that idea continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a unique story, it&#8217;s just a really important and highly visible one that&#8217;s fun to hold up. In fact, just in the last 6 months engineers as Igalia have worked on CSS Containment, ResizeObserver, BigInt, private fields and methods, responsive image preloading, CSS Text Level 3, bringing MathML to Chromium, normalizing SVG and MathML DOMs and a lot more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we may have lost in browser engine diversity we may gain back in the openness of browser engines and outside players stepping up.</p>

<p class="explanation"><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/edges-announcements/">here are the official announcements</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-279952"></span></p>
<h3>Andre Garzia</h3>
<p><a href="https://andregarzia.com/2018/12/while-we-blink-we-loose-the-web.html">While we Blink, we loose the Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though Opera, Beaker and Brave are all doing very good work, it is still Chrome engine behind them and that limits the amount of stuff they can build and innovate. It is like as if they were building cars, there is a lot they can do without actually changing the engine itself, and thats what the Web Browsers are becoming, everyone is working on parts of the car but all the engines are now Chrome and believe me, you don’t want all the engines to be the same, not even if they are all Gecko or if somehow we resurrect Presto, we want diversity of engines and not monoculture.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Tim Kadlec</h3>
<p><a href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-12-04-risking-a-homogenous-web/">Risking a Homogeneous Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can understand the logic. Microsoft can’t put as many folks on Edge (including EdgeHTML for rendering and Chakra for JavaScript) as Google has done with Chromium (using Blink for rendering and V8 for JavaScript), so keeping up was always going to be a challenge. Now they can contribute to the same codebase and try to focus on the user-focused features. Whether this gets people to pay more attention to their next browser or not remains to be seen, but I get the thinking behind the move.</p>
<p>The big concern here is we’ve lost another voice from an engine perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Ferdy Christant</h3>
<p><a href="https://ferdychristant.com/the-state-of-web-browsers-f5a83a41c1cb">The State of Web Browsers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Edge is doomed. It was doomed and its next version will be equally doomed from the start. For the simple reason that Microsoft has close to no say in how browsers get installed: on mobile as a default app, and on desktop via web services under the control of Google. Switching to Chromium makes no difference in market share, as the only way to compete now is through the browser’s UI, not via the engine. Which isn’t a competition at all, since browser UI is a commodity.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Chris Beard (as Mozilla)</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/">Goodbye, EdgeHTML</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By adopting Chromium, Microsoft hands over control of even more of online life to Google.</p>
<p>This may sound melodramatic, but it’s not. The “browser engines” — Chromium from Google and Gecko Quantum from Mozilla — are “inside baseball” pieces of software that actually determine a great deal of what each of us can do online. They determine core capabilities such as which content we as consumers can see, how secure we are when we watch content, and how much control we have over what websites and services can do to us. Microsoft’s decision gives Google more ability to single-handedly decide what possibilities are available to each one of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Dave Rupert</h3>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/12/edge-goes-chromium/">#​Edge​Goes​Chromium</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the big reasons I switched to Edge was because I wanted to promote this idea of “Browser Diversity”. Developers who listen to Shop Talk would at least know one person who doesn’t use Chrome daily. I’m not sure where this news puts me. I like Edge. I think it’s by far the best browser on Windows 10. By miles. Not even kidding. So it’d be a tough pill to swallow and give up. In many ways, I just got a major upgrade that includes my preferred performance dev tooling.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Daniel Glazman</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2018/12/09/Edge-and-Chromium%2C-a-different-analysis">Edge and Chromium, a different analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I think the whole thing is not about Edge. The microcosm reacted, and reacted precisely as expected (again, probable laughters in Redmond), but this is really about Windows and the core of activity of Microsoft. Impulsing a change like a move to Chromium and using it as a public announcement by a Windows CVP, is, beyond technical and business choices, a political signal. It says « expect the unexpected ».</p>
<p>I think Microsoft Windows as we know it is about to change and change drastically. Windows as we know it could even die and Microsoft move to another new, different operating system, Edge+Chromium&#8217;s announcement being only the top of the iceberg. And it&#8217;s well known that 9/10th of an iceberg remain below water surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Owen Williams</h3>
<p><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/59vke8/microsoft-putting-edge-on-chromium-will-fundamentally-change-the-web">Microsoft Putting Edge on Chromium Will Fundamentally Change the Web:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electron today, however, comes with a sizable disadvantage: it&#8217;s based on the Chromium browser, which means it&#8217;s bundled with an entire instance for each application that uses it on your machine. Having Slack and Chrome open, for example, spawns two isolated Chromium instances, both consuming resources to do much the same thing.</p>
<p>With this shift, it&#8217;s easy to imagine a single shared thread for Chromium on top of Windows, which can be accessed by any Electron-based instance. Such a change would allow Electron apps to be more efficient, stable, and friendlier on system resources (particularly memory and battery.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Jeffrey Zeldman</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.zeldman.com/2018/12/07/browser-diversity-starts-with-us/">Browser Diversity Starts With Us</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When one rendering engine rules them all, well, many of us remember when progress halted for close to ten years because developers only tested in IE6, and more than a few of us recall a similar period when Netscape was the only browser that mattered.</p>
<p>Don’t think the need to test in phones will save us: Chromium powers most of them, too.</p>
<p>And don’t write off the desktop just because many of us love our phones more.</p>
<p>When one company decides which ideas are worth supporting and which aren’t, which access problems matter and which don’t, it stifles innovation, crushes competition, and opens the door to excluding people from digital experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Andy Bell</h3>
<p><a href="https://andy-bell.design/wrote/browser-diversity/">Browser diversity:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The main reason I am wary is that I have a lot of mistrust of Microsoft and Google even before this situation, so I’m naturally not going to embrace them being in close cahoots with each other. Not just this relationship, though because as others have articulated better than I ever can, there’s a huge worry about a lack of diversity with web browsers.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Adrian Roselli</h3>
<p><a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2018/12/stepping-back-from-the-edge.html">Stepping Back from the Edge:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Web standards survived the monoculture of Mosaic because Netscape came to the market. Web standards survived the Netscape monoculture because Internet Explorer emerged as a challenger. Internet Explorer’s monoculture was broken by Chrome, backed up by a push for web standards and interoperability. Chrome has no obvious challenger because no other company has the scale, the market and product saturation, nor the truly independent standards bodies to contain it.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Peter-Paul Koch</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2018/12/chromedge_and_h.html">Chromedge and headcount:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Is one unexpected benefit of the switch to Chromium that the Edge team can actually expand? It’s easier to get Chromium engineers than EdgeHTML ones, that’s for sure.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Jeremy Keith</h3>
<p><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/14608">Browsers:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s just no sugar-coating this. I’m sure the decision makes sound business sense for Microsoft, but it’s not good for the health of the web.</p>
<p>Very soon, the vast majority of browsers will have an engine that’s either Blink or its cousin, WebKit. That may seem like good news for developers when it comes to testing, but trust me, it’s a sucky situation of innovation and agreement. Instead of a diverse browser ecosystem, we’re going to end up with incest and inbreeding.</p>
<p>There’s one shining exception though. Firefox. That browser was originally created to combat the seemingly unstoppable monopolistic power of Internet Explorer. Now that Microsoft are no longer in the rendering engine game, Firefox is once again the only thing standing in the way of a complete monopoly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early in my career when I worked at agencies and later at Microsoft on Edge, I heard the same lament over and over: <em>&#8220;Argh, why doesn’t Edge just run on Blink? Then I would have access to ALL THE APIs I want to use and would only have to test in one browser!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Let me be clear: an Internet that runs only on Chrome’s engine, Blink, and its offspring, is not the paradise we like to imagine it to be.</p>
<p>As a Google Developer Expert who has worked on Microsoft Edge, with Firefox, and with the W3C as an Invited Expert, I have some opinions (and a number of facts) to drop on this topic. Let’s get to it.</p>
<p><span id="more-275463"></span></p>
<h3>What is a browser, even?</h3>
<p>Let’s clear up some terminology. </p>
<p>Popular browsers you know today include Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, but in the past we’ve also had such greats as NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator. Whichever browser you use daily (I use Firefox, thanks for asking) is only an interface layer wrapped around a browser engine. All your bookmarks, the forward and backward arrows, that URL bar thingy—those <em>aren’t the browser.</em> Those are the browser’s interface. Often the people who build the browser’s engine never even touch the interface! </p>
<p>Browser engines are the things that actually read all the HTML and CSS and JavaScript that come down across the Internet, interpret them, and display a pretty picture of a web page for you. They have their own names. Chrome’s engine is Blink. Safari runs on WebKit. Firefox uses Gecko. Edge sits on top of EdgeHTML. (I like this naming convention. Good job, Edge.) </p>
<p>Except for Edge, all of these engines are open source, meaning anybody could grab one, wrap it in a new interface, and boom, release their own browser—maybe with a different (perhaps better) user experience—and that’s just what some browsers are! Apple only allows webKit-based browsers in its iOS app store, so the Chrome, Firefox, and even Edge browsers on iPads and iPhones work more like Safari than their desktop counterparts. Oculus Browser, Brave, Vivaldi, Samsung Internet, Amazon’s Silk, and Opera all run on Blink. We call them “Chromium-based browsers”—Chromium is Google’s <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium">open source project</a> from which Chrome and its engine emerged.</p>
<p>But what’s inside a browser engine? MOAR ENGINES! Every browser engine is comprised of several other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A layout and rendering engine</strong> (often so tightly coupled that there’s no distinction) that calculates how the page should look and handles any paints, renders, and even animations.</li>
<li><strong>A JavaScript engine</strong>, which is its own thing and can even run independently of the browser altogether. For instance, you can use Chrome’s V8 engine or Microsoft Edge’s Chakra to run Node on a server.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="post-275492" class="align-left media-275492"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ecology-1-1.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<p>I like to compare browser engines to biological cells. Where a cell contains many organelles to perform different functions, so too do browsers. One can think of the nucleus as the rendering engine, containing the blueprints for how the page should display, and the mitochondria as the JavaScript engine, powering our everyday interactions. (Fun fact: mitochondria used to be standalone cells at one point, too, and they even carry <i>their own DNA!</i>) </p>
<p>And you know what? Another way browsers are like living things is that they evolve.</p>
<h3>Browser evolution</h3>
<p>Back when the first browsers came out, it was a simpler time. CSS was considered the hot new thing when it first appeared in Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 in 1996! There were far fewer JavaScript APIs and CSS specifications to implement than there are today. Over the years, browser codebases have grown to support the number of new features users and developers require to build modern web experiences. It is a delicate evolution between user needs, browser engineering effort, and specification standardization processes.</p>
<p>We have three major lineages of engines right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebKit and Blink (Blink originally being a fork of WebKit) running Safari, Chrome, and Opera</li>
<li>Gecko running Firefox</li>
<li>EdgeHTML (a fork of Trident, aka MSHTML) running Microsoft Edge</li>
</ul>
<p>Each is very different and has different strengths and weaknesses. Each could pull the Web in a different direction alone: Firefox’s engine has <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo&#8217;s multithreaded processing</a> for rendering blazing fast graphics. Edge’s engine has the least abstraction from the operating system, giving it more direct access to system resources—but making it a Windows-only browser engine as a result. And Chrome’s Blink has the most web developers testing for it. (I&#8217;ll get back to why this is a &#8220;feature&#8221; in a little bit.)</p>
<p>Remember all those Chromium-based browsers we talked about? Well, none of these browsers have to build their rendering engine or JavaScript engines from scratch: they just piggy-back off of Blink. And if there are new features they need? They can develop those features and keep them to themselves, or they can share those features back “upstream” to become a part of the core engine for other browsers to use. (This process is often fraught with politics and logistics—&#8221;contributing back&#8221; is easier <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Introduction">said</a> than <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code">done</a>!)</p>
<figure id="post-275490" class="align-left media-275490"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ecology-2.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<p>It is hard to imagine any one entity justifying the hours and expense it would take to spin up a browser engine from scratch today. Even the current three engine families are evolutions of engines that were there from the very start of the Internet. They’ve evolved piecemeal alongside us, growing to meet our needs.</p>
<p>Right now, the vast majority of traffic on the Web is happening on Chrome, iOS Safari, or some other permutation of Blink or WebKit.</p>
<h4>Branches, renovations, and gut jobs</h4>
<p>Some developers would say that WebKit and Blink were forked so long ago that the two are practically completely different browser engines now, no longer able to share contributions. That may be true to a point. But while a common chimney swift and a ruby-throated hummingbird are completely different animals in comparison to each other, when compared to the other animal families, they are still very much birds. Neither’s immediate offspring are likely to manifest teeth, hands, or tails in the near future. Neither WebKit nor Blink have the processing features that Gecko and EdgeHTML have been building up to for years.</p>
<p>Other developers might point out that Microsoft Edge is supposedly a &#8220;complete rewrite&#8221; of Internet Explorer. But the difference between a &#8220;complete gut job&#8221; and a mere &#8220;renovation&#8221; can be a matter of perspective. EdgeHTML is a fork of Internet Explorer&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(software)">Trident engine</a>, and it still carries much of Trident&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/">backlog</a> with it.</p>
<h3>Browser extinction</h3>
<p>So these are the three browser engines we have: WebKit/Blink, Gecko, and EdgeHTML. We are unlikely to get any brand new bloodlines in the foreseeable future. This is it.</p>
<p>If we lose one of those browser engines, we lose its lineage, every permutation of that engine that would follow, and the unique takes on the Web it could allow for. </p>
<p>And it’s not likely to be replaced.</p>
<figure id="post-275487" class="align-left media-275487"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ecology-3.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<p>Imagine a planet populated only by hummingbirds, dolphins, and horses. Say all the dolphins died out. In the far, far future, hummingbirds or horses could evolve into something that could swim in the ocean like a dolphin. Indeed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaur">ichthyosaurs</a> in the era of dinosaurs looked much like dolphins. But that creature would be very different from a true dolphin: even ichthyosaurs never developed echolocation. We would wait a very long time (possibly forever) for a bloodline to evolve the traits we already have present in other bloodlines today. So, why is it ok to stand by or even encourage the extinction of one of these valuable, unique lineages?</p>
<p>We have already lost one. </p>
<p>We used to have four major rendering engines, but Opera halted development of its own rendering engine Presto before adopting Blink. </p>
<p><em>Three left.</em> Spend them wisely. </p>
<h4>By our powers combined&#8230;</h4>
<p>Some folks feel that if a browser like Microsoft Edge ran on Blink, then Microsoft&#8217;s engineers could help build a better Blink, contributing new features upstream for all other Chromium browsers to benefit from. This sounds sensible, right?</p>
<p>But remember Blink was forked from WebKit. Now there are WebKit contributors and Blink contributors, and their contributions don&#8217;t port one to one. It&#8217;s not unlikely that a company like Microsoft would, much like Samsung and Occulus, want to do things with the engine differently from Google. And if those differences are not aligned, the company will work on a parallel codebase and not contribute that work upstream. We end up with a WebKit and a Blink—but without the deep differentiation that comes from having a codebase that has been growing with the Internet for decades.</p>
<p>It’s is a nice idea in theory. But in practice, we end up in a similar pickle—and with less &#8220;genetic variety&#8221; in our ecosystem of browser engines.</p>
<h3>Competition is about growing, not &#8220;winning&#8221;</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan of competition. Competing with other cartoonists to make better comics and reach a larger audience got me to where I am today. (True story: <a href="https://byrslf.co/dont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2">got my start</a> building websites as a cartoonist building her own community site, newsletter, and shopping cart.) I like to remind people that competition isn&#8217;t about annihilating your competitors. If you did, you&#8217;d stagnate and lose your audience: see also Internet Explorer 6.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 6 was an amazing browser when it came out: performant enough to really deliver on features previous versions of Internet Explorer introduced like the DOM, data-binding, and asynchronous JavaScript. Its rival, Netscape Navigator, couldn&#8217;t compete and crumbled into dust (only to have its engine, Gecko, rewritten from scratch—it was that small!—by the Mozilla Foundation to be reborn as Firefox later).</p>
<p>Thinking it had <em>Won the Internet</em>, Microsoft turned its attention to other fronts, and Internet Explorer didn&#8217;t advance much. This allowed Firefox to get a toehold—by giving users a better experience with features like pop-up up blocking and a better UI. (That interface layer really does matter!) Firefox also collaborated with Opera to advanced Web standards, which weren&#8217;t really a thing in the IE vs Netscape days. People using and building for the Internet loved it, and Firefox spread like <em>fire</em> (&lt;/dad-joke&gt;) through word of mouth and grass roots promotional campaigns.</p>
<p>When the iPhone came, Apple focused on its profitable apps marketplace and cut efforts to support Flash—the Web’s most app-like interaction platform. Apps gave content creators a way to monetize their efforts with something other than an advertising model. Advertising being Google&#8217;s bread and butter, the Big G grew concerned as the threat of a walled garden of apps only using the Internet for data plumbing loomed. Microsoft, meanwhile, was preoccupied with building its own mobile <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. So Google did two things: Android and Chrome.</p>
<p>Chrome promised a better, faster browsing experience. <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-09-01-n47.html">It was barebones</a>, but Google even went all out and got famous (in my circles at least) cartoonist Scott McCloud to <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/">make a comic</a> explaining the browser&#8217;s mission to users. With Chrome&#8217;s omnipresence on every operating system and Android phone, its dev tools modeled off Firefox&#8217;s beloved Firebug extension, and increasing involvement in specs, Chrome not only shook Internet Explorer out of its slumber, it was damn near threatening to kill off every other browser engine on the planet!</p>
<p>Pruning the great family tree of browsers (or collection of bushes as it were) down to a single branch smacks of fragile monoculture. Monocultures are easily disrupted by environmental and ecological challenges—by market and demographic changes. What happens when the next threat to the Web rears its head, but we don&#8217;t have Firefox&#8217;s multithreading? Or Microsoft Edge&#8217;s system integration? Will we be able to iterate fast enough without them? Or will we look to the Chrome developers to do something and pray that they have not grown stagnant as Google turned, like Microsoft did, to attend to other matters after &#8220;winning the Web.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is ironic that the browser Google built to keep the Web from losing to the apps model is itself monopolizing web development much the same way Internet Explorer 6 did.</p>
<figure id="post-275485" class="align-left media-275485"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ecology-4.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<h3>It&#8217;s good to be king (of the jungle)</h3>
<p>I promised I&#8217;d get back to &#8220;user base size as a feature.&#8221; Having the vast majority of the web development community building and testing for your platform is a major competitive advantage. First off, you&#8217;re guaranteed that most sites are going to work perfectly in your browser—you won&#8217;t have to spend so much time and effort tapping Fortune 500 sites on the shoulder about this One Weird Bug that is causing all their internal users to switch to your competitor browser and never come back. A downward spiral of fewer users leading to less developer testing leading to fewer users begins that is hard to shake.</p>
<p>It also makes it much easier to propose new specifications that serve your parent company&#8217;s goals (which may or may not serve the web community&#8217;s goals) and have that large community of developers build to your implementation first without having to wait for other browsers to catch up. If a smaller browser proposes a spec that no one notices and you pick it up when you need it, people will remember it as being your effort, continuing to build your mindshare whether intentionally or not.</p>
<p>This creates downward pressure on the competition, which simply doesn’t have or cannot use the same resources the biggest browser team has at its disposal. It’s a brutally efficient method, whether by design or accident.</p>
<p>Is it virtuous? At the individual contributor level, yes. Is it a vicious cycle by which companies have driven their competition to extinction by forcing them to spend limited resources to catch up? Also yes. And having legions of people building for just your platform helps.</p>
<p>All the awesome, well-meaning, genuinely good-hearted people involved—from the Chrome team to web developers—can throw their hands up and legitimately say, “I was just trying to build the Web forward!” while contributing to further a corporate monopoly.</p>
<p>Chrome has the most resources and leads the pack in building the Web forward to the point that we can’t be sure if we’re building the Web we want&#8230; <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/bits/">or the Web Google wants</a>.</p>
<h3>Speculative biology</h3>
<p>There was a time when Microsoft <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech-0806/">bailed out Apple</a> as it was about to sink. This was not because Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were friends—no, Microsoft needed Apple to succeed so there would still be operating system competition. (No business wants to be seen as a monopoly!)</p>
<p>But consider, for a moment, that Apple <em>had</em> died. What would personal computers be like today if we’d only had Linux and Windows left standing? What would mobile computing look like if Apple hadn&#8217;t been around to work on the iPhone?</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s easier to develop and test in only one browser. I&#8217;m sure IT professionals would have loved to only support one kind of machine. But variety creates opportunity for us as developers in the long run. Microsoft saving Apple lead to apps which challenged the Web which gave us Chrome and the myriad of APIs Google is charging ahead with. If at any point in this chain of events someone had said, &#8220;Meh, it&#8217;s so much easier if we all use the same thing,&#8221; we wouldn&#8217;t have the careers—or the world—that we have now.</p>
<p>Develop in more than one browser. Test in more than one browser. Use more than one browser. </p>
<p>You are both consumer and producer. You have a say in how the future plays out.</p>
<p class="explanation"><strong>Update:</strong> I updated this post to expand just a little bit on WebKit on iOS, the role of Firefox during the era of IE6, and to explicitly call attention to Servo, which is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCBWS8G5Cm0&#038;ab_channel=JSKongress">the most exciting thing happening in browsers</a> right now.</p>
