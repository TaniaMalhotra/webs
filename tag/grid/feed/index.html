<p>In this demo by Jesse Breneman, a grid of hexagons is created by setting up the grid columns with math such that each block can span over three columns and two rows so that the blocks overlap in a way that allows a <code>clip-path</code> to be applied around them. This carves a block into a hexagon that is evenly spaced with the others. Very clever.</p>

<p>I discovered CSS about a decade ago while trying to modify the look of a blog I had created. Pretty soon, I was able to code <a href="https://codepen.io/thebabydino/details/GRgYQge">cool things</a> with more mathematical and, therefore, easier-to-understand features like transforms. However, other areas of CSS, such as layout, have remained a constant source of pain.</p>



<p>This post is about a problem I encountered about a decade ago and, until recently, did not know how to solve in a smart way. Specifically, it&#8217;s about how I found a solution to a long-running problem using a modern CSS grid technique that, in the process, gave me even cooler results than I originally imagined.</p>



<span id="more-311528"></span>



<p class="explanation">That this is not a tutorial on how to best use CSS grid, but more of a walk through my own learning process.</p>



<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>



<p>One of the first things I used to dump on that blog were random photos from the city, so I had this idea about having a grid of thumbnails with a fixed size. For a nicer look, I wanted this grid to be middle-aligned with respect to the paragraphs above and below it, but, at the same time, I wanted the thumbnails on the last row to be left-aligned with respect to the grid. Meanwhile, the width of the post (and the width of the grid within it) would depend on the viewport.</p>



<figure><video src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/f24Y9Zob/thumb_grid_prob_hd.mp4" controls></figure>



<p>The HTML looks something like this:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;section class='post__content'>
  &lt;p>&lt;!-- some text -->&lt;/p>
  &lt;div class='grid--thumbs'>
    &lt;a href='full-size-image.jpg'>
      &lt;img src='thumb-image.jpg' alt='image description'/>
    &lt;/a>
    &lt;!-- more such thumbnails -->
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;p>&lt;!-- some more text -->&lt;/p>
&lt;/section></code></pre>



<p>It may seem simple, but it turned out to be one of the most difficult CSS problems I&#8217;ve ever encountered.</p>



<h3 id="bad-solutions">Less than ideal solutions</h3>



<p>These are things I have tried or seen suggested over the years, but that never really got me anywhere.</p>



<h4 id="bad-float">Floating impossibility</h4>



<p>Floats turned out to be a dead end because I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to make the grid be middle aligned this way.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid--thumbs { overflow: hidden; }

.grid--thumbs a { float: left; }</code></pre>



<p>The demo below shows the float attempt. Resize the embed to see how they behave at different viewport widths.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ZEbmLMa" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ZEbmLMa?height=500&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ZEbmLMa&amp;default-tab=result" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ZEbmLMa" title="CodePen Embed ZEbmLMa" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<h4 id="bad-inline-block"><code>inline-block</code> madness</h4>



<p>At first, this seemed like a better idea:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid--thumbs { text-align: center }

.grid--thumbs a { display: inline-block }</code></pre>



<p>Except it turned out it wasn&#8217;t:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_JjYeWao" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/JjYeWao?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=JjYeWao&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed JjYeWao" title="CodePen Embed JjYeWao" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>The last row isn&#8217;t left aligned in this case.</p>



<p>At a certain point, thanks to an accidental CSS auto-complete on CodePen, I found out about a property called <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-align-last/">text-align-last</a></code>, which determines how the last line of a block is aligned.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, setting <code>text-align-last: left</code> on the grid wasn&#8217;t the solution I was looking for either:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_LYpXWoN" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/LYpXWoN?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=LYpXWoN&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed LYpXWoN" title="CodePen Embed LYpXWoN" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>At this point, I actually considered dropping the idea of a middle aligned grid. Could a combo of <code>text-align: justified</code> and <code>text-align-last: left</code> on the grid produce a better result?</p>



<p>Well, turns out it doesn&#8217;t. That is, unless there&#8217;s only a thumbnail on the last row and the gaps between the columns aren&#8217;t too big. Resize the embed below to see what I mean.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QWjJvWJ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QWjJvWJ?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QWjJvWJ&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QWjJvWJ" title="CodePen Embed QWjJvWJ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>This is pretty much where I was at two years ago, after nine years of trying and failing to come up with a solution to this problem.</p>



<h4 id="bad-flex">Messy flexbox hacks</h4>



<p>A flexbox solution that seemed like it would work at first was to add an <code>::after</code> pseudo-element on the grid and set <code>flex: 1</code> on both the thumbnails and this pseudo-element:</p>



<pre rel="SCSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid--thumbs {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
	
  a, &amp;::after { flex: 1; }
	
  img { margin: auto; }
	
  &amp;:after { content: 'AFTER'; }
}</code></pre>



<p>The demo below shows how this method works. I&#8217;ve given the thumbnails and the <code>::after</code> pseudo-element purple outlines to make it easier to see what is going on.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_GRpwmqQ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/GRpwmqQ?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GRpwmqQ&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed GRpwmqQ" title="CodePen Embed GRpwmqQ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>This is not quite what I wanted because the grid of thumbnails is not middle-aligned. Thats said, it doesn&#8217;t look too bad&#8230; as long as the last row has exactly one item less image than the others. As soon as that changes, however, the layout breaks if it&#8217;s missing more items or none.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/screen_flex_after_issue.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot collage. Shows how the layout breaks when the last row is not missing exactly one item to be full." data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption>Why the <code>::after</code> hack is not reliable.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That was one hacky idea. Another is not to use a pseudo-element, but add as many empty divs after the thumbnails as there are columns that we&#8217;re expecting to have.</p>



<p>The expected number of columns is something we should be able to approximate since the size of the thumbnails is fixed and we probably want to set a maximum width for the post since text that stretches across the width of a full screen can visually exhausting for eyes to read. Dividing the maximum width by the fixed thumbnail width should give us the maximum number of columns in this case.</p>



<p>The first empty elements will take up the full width of the row that&#8217;s not completely filled with thumbnails, while the rest will spill into other rows. But since their <code>height</code> is zero, it won&#8217;t matter visually.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_VwvVqxv" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/VwvVqxv?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=VwvVqxv&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed VwvVqxv" title="CodePen Embed VwvVqxv" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>This kind of does the trick but, again, it&#8217;s hacky and still doesn&#8217;t produce the exact result I want since it sometimes ends up with big and kind of ugly-looking gaps between the columns.</p>



<h4 id="bad-grid">A grid solution?</h4>



<p>The grid layout has always sounded like the answer, given its name. The problem was that all examples I had seen by then were using a predefined number of columns and that doesn&#8217;t work for this particular pattern where the number of columns is determined by the viewport width.</p>



<p>Last year, while coding a collection of one element, pure CSS background patterns, I had the idea of generating a bunch of media queries that would modify a CSS variable, <code>--n</code>, corresponding to the number of columns used to set <code>grid-template-columns</code>.</p>



<pre rel="SCSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss" data-line=""><code markup="tt">$w: 13em;
$h: 19em;
$f: $h/$w;
$n: 7;
$g: 1em;

--h: #{$f*$w};
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--n, #{$n}), var(--w, #{$w}));
grid-gap: $g;
place-content: center;
	
@for $i from 1 to $n {
  @media (max-width: ($n - $i + 1)*$w + ($n - $i + 2)*$g) {
    --n: #{$n - $i}
  }
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_GRRpzNX" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/GRRpzNX?height=600&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GRRpzNX&amp;default-tab=result" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed GRRpzNX" title="CodePen Embed GRRpzNX" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>I was actually super proud of this idea at the time, even though I cringe looking back on it now. One media query for every number of columns possible is not exactly ideal, not to mention it doesn&#8217;t work so well when the grid width doesn&#8217;t equal the viewport width, but is still somewhat flexible and also depends on the width of its siblings.</p>



<h3 id="magic-solution">A magic solution</h3>



<p>I finally came across a better solution while working with CSS grid and failing to understand why the <code>repeat()</code> function wasn&#8217;t working in a particular situation. It was so frustrating and prompted me to go to MDN, where I happened to notice the <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/">auto-fit</a></code> keyword and, while I didn&#8217;t understand the explanation, I had a hunch that it could help with <em>this</em> other problem, so I dropped everything else I was doing and gave it a try.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I got:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid--thumbs {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
  grid-gap: .25em;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 8em);
}</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_eYpQbQx" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/eYpQbQx?height=500&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=eYpQbQx&amp;default-tab=result" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed eYpQbQx" title="CodePen Embed eYpQbQx" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>I also discovered the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax"><code>minmax()</code></a> function, which can be used in place of fixed sizes on grid items. I still haven&#8217;t been able to understand exactly how <code>minmax()</code> works — and the more I play with it, the less I understand it — but what it looks like it does in this situation is create the grid then stretch its columns equally until they fill all of the available space:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(8em, 1fr));</code></pre>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_eYpbQgd" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/eYpbQgd?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=eYpbQgd&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed eYpbQgd" title="CodePen Embed eYpbQgd" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Another cool thing we can do here is prevent the image from overflowing when it&#8217;s wider than the grid element. We can do this by replacing the minimum <code>8em</code> with <code>min(8em, 100%)</code> That essentially ensures that images will never exceed 100%, but never below 8em. Thanks to Chris for this suggestion!</p>



<p class="explanation">Note that the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min"><code>min()</code></a> function doesn&#8217;t work in pre-Chromium Edge!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ZEbVVpv" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ZEbVVpv?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ZEbVVpv&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ZEbVVpv" title="CodePen Embed ZEbVVpv" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Keep in mind that this only produces a nice result if all of the images have the same aspect ratio — like the square images I&#8217;ve used here. For my blog, this was not an issue since all photos were taken with my Sony Ericsson W800i phone, and they all had the same aspect ratio. But if we were to drop images with different aspect ratios, the grid wouldn&#8217;t look as good anymore:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_dyYwazO" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/dyYwazO?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=dyYwazO&amp;default-tab=result" height="650" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed dyYwazO" title="CodePen Embed dyYwazO" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>We can, of course, set the image <code>height</code> to a fixed value, but that distorts the images&#8230; unless we set <a href="https://css-tricks.com/on-object-fit-and-object-position/"><code>object-fit</code></a> to <code>cover</code>, which solves our problem!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_JjYwzmL" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/JjYwzmL?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=JjYwzmL&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed JjYwzmL" title="CodePen Embed JjYwzmL" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Another idea would be to turn the first thumbnail into a sort of banner that spans all grid columns. The one problem is that we don&#8217;t know the number of columns because that depends on the viewport. But, there <em>is</em> a solution — we can set <code>grid-column-end</code> to <code>-1</code>!</p>



<pre rel="SCSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid--thumbs {
  /* same styles as before */
	
  a:first-child {
    grid-column: 1/ -1;
		
    img { height: 13em }
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>The first image gets a bigger <code>height</code> than all the others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_vYNbJJo" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/vYNbJJo?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=vYNbJJo&amp;default-tab=result" height="650" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed vYNbJJo" title="CodePen Embed vYNbJJo" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>Of course, if we wanted the image to span all columns except the last, one we&#8217;d set it to <code>-2</code> and so on&#8230; negative column indices are a thing!</p>



<p><code>auto-fill</code> is another grid property keyword I noticed on MDN. The explanations for both are long walls of text without visuals, so I didn&#8217;t find them particularly useful. Even worse, replacing <code>auto-fit</code> with <code>auto-fill</code> in any of the grid demos above produces absolutely no difference. How they really work and how they differ still remains a mystery, even after checking out <a href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/#article-header-id-0">articles</a> or toying with <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example37/">examples</a>.</p>



<p>However, trying out different things and seeing what happens in various scenarios at one point led me to the conclusion that, if we&#8217;re using a <code>minmax()</code> column width and not a fixed one (like <code>8em</code>), then it&#8217;s probably better to use <code>auto-fill</code> instead of <code>auto-fit</code> because, the result looks better if we happen to only have a few images, as illustrated by the interactive demo below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QWjovRV" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QWjovRV?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QWjovRV&amp;default-tab=result" height="650" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QWjovRV" title="CodePen Embed QWjovRV" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>I think what I personally like best is the initial idea of a thumbnail grid that&#8217;s middle-aligned and has a mostly fixed column width (but still uses <code>min(100%, 15em)</code> instead of just <code>15em</code> though). At the end of the day, it&#8217;s a matter of personal preference and what can be seen in the demo below just happens to look better to me:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_yLYPzgd" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/yLYPzgd?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yLYPzgd&amp;default-tab=result" height="650" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed yLYPzgd" title="CodePen Embed yLYPzgd" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>I&#8217;m using <code>auto-fit</code> in this demo because it produces the same result as <code>auto-fill</code> and is one character shorter. However, what I didn&#8217;t understand when making this is that both keywords produce the same result because there are more items in the gallery than we need to fill a row.</p>



<p>But once that changes, <code>auto-fit</code> and <code>auto-fill</code> produce different results, as illustrated below. You can change the <code>justify-content</code> value and the number of items placed on the grid:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_gOayvpb" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/gOayvpb?height=750&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=gOayvpb&amp;default-tab=result" height="750" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed gOayvpb" title="CodePen Embed gOayvpb" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>I&#8217;m not really sure which is the better choice. I guess this also depends on personal preference. Coupled with <code>justify-content: center</code>, <code>auto-fill</code> seems to be the more logical option, but, at the same time, <code>auto-fit</code> produces a better-looking result.</p>

<p>If you match the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> with a situation like this, it&#8217;s not exactly magic numbers, but it still doesn&#8217;t feel great to me beaus they&#8217;re still numbers you need to keep in sync across totally different elements. </p>



<p>His idea? Build it with CSS grid instead. <a href="https://codepen.io/snookca/pen/ExVOWWM">Definitely feels much more robust</a>. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s not at the level of demand as, say, container queries, but being able to make &#8220;masonry&#8221; layouts in CSS has been a big ask for CSS developers for a long time. Masonry being that kind of layout where unevenly-sized elements are layed out in ragged rows. Sorta like a typical brick wall turned sideways. </p>



<p>The layout alone <a href="https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/">is achievable in CSS alone already</a>, but with one big caveat: the items aren&#8217;t arranged in rows, they are arranged in columns, which is often a deal-breaker for folks.</p>



<span id="more-308358"></span>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* People usually don't want this */

1  4  6  8
2     7
3  5     9</code></pre>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* They want this *.

1  2  3  4
5  6     7
8     9</code></pre>
</div>
</div>



<p>If you want that ragged row thing and horizontal source order, you&#8217;re in JavaScript territory. Until now, that is, as<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4650#issuecomment-620864503"> Firefox rolled this out under a feature flag</a> in Firefox Nightly, as part of CSS grid.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4650#issuecomment-620864503">Mats Palmgren</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>An implementation of this proposal is now available in Firefox&nbsp;<a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Nightly</a>. It is disabled by default, so you need to load&nbsp;<code>about:config</code>&nbsp;and set the preference&nbsp;<code>layout.css.grid-template-masonry-value.enabled</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;to enable it (type &#8220;masonry&#8221; in the search box on that page and it will show you that pref).</p></blockquote>



<p>Jen Simmons has created some demos already:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QWjqbJj" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QWjqbJj?height=750&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QWjqbJj&amp;default-tab=result" height="750" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QWjqbJj" title="CodePen Embed QWjqbJj" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<h3>Is this really a grid?</h3>



<p>A bit of pushback <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2020/05/05/does-masonry-belong-in-the-css-grid-specification/">from Rachel Andrew</a>&#8230;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Grid isn’t Masonry, because it’s a grid with strict rows and columns. If you take another look at the layout created by Masonry, we don’t have strict rows and columns. Typically we have defined rows, but the columns act more like a flex layout, or Multicol. The key difference between the layout you get with Multicol and a Masonry layout, is that in Multicol the items are displayed by column. Typically in a Masonry layout you want them displayed row-wise.<br><br>[&#8230;]<br><br>Speaking personally, I am not a huge fan of this being part of the Grid specification. It is certainly compelling at first glance, however I feel that this is a relatively specialist layout mode and actually isn’t a grid at all. It is more akin to flex layout than grid layout.</p><p>By placing this layout method into the Grid spec I worry that we then tie ourselves to needing to support the Masonry functionality with any other additions to Grid.</p></blockquote>



<p>None of this is final yet, and there is <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4650">active CSS Working Group discussion about it</a>. </p>



<p>As Jen said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This is an experimental implementation — being discussed as a&nbsp;<em>possible</em>&nbsp;CSS specification. It is NOT yet official, and likely will change. Do not write blog posts saying this is definitely a thing. It&#8217;s not a thing. Not yet. It&#8217;s an experiment. A prototype. If you have thoughts, chime in at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4650">the CSSWG</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h3>Houdini?</h3>



<p>Last time there was chatter about native masonry, it was mingled with idea that the <a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-layout-api/">CSS Layout API</a>, as part of <a href="https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/">Houdini</a>, could do this. That is a thing, as you can see by opening <a href="https://googlechromelabs.github.io/houdini-samples/layout-worklet/masonry/">this demo</a> (<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/houdini-samples/tree/master/layout-worklet/masonry">repo</a>) in Chrome Canary. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m not totally up to speed on whether Houdini is intended to be a thing so that ideas like this can be prototyped in the browser and ultimately moved out of Houdini, or if the ideas should just stay in Houdini, or what.</p>

<p>Everything is flexible these days. If you write <code>grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;</code>, sure, you&#8217;d have equal-width columns, but that&#8217;s a rare day. What you usually mean is <em>three columns of equal fluid width</em>. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/">fractional units</a> for that, like <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr fr;</code>. That&#8217;s usually fine, but they aren&#8217;t very <em>sturdy</em> like pixels. A large bit of media (or something like a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, or long bit of text like a URL) can cause those columns to stretch and that&#8217;s almost never what you want. I&#8217;ve called that <a href="https://css-tricks.com/preventing-a-grid-blowout/">a grid blowout</a>. The big idea is that the minimum width of a <code>1fr</code> column is <code>auto</code>, not <code>0</code>. In other words,. those widened columns are just being as narrow as they know how to be!</p>



<span id="more-310146"></span>



<p>To fix that, we can do like:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 1fr);
}</code></pre>



<p>..or we could shorten it: </p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.el {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));
}</code></pre>



<p> It&#8217;s a little awkward, but OK. You only gotta learn it once. You might not even ever run into this if you&#8217;re always setting <code>max-width</code> on your media and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/prevent-long-urls-from-breaking-out-of-container/">handling line breaks</a>. </p>



<p>If you want to make your columns sturdy again without the <code>minmax</code> dance, you could use percentages rather than pixels and stay flexible. But what percentage do you use? <code>33.33%</code>? That&#8217;s fine as long as you don&#8217;t have any <code>gap</code> — otherwise, the gap will add to the width and overflow the container. You could fake gaps by putting padding inside the columns, but that&#8217;s a little janky and uneven. </p>



<p>This whole thing comes from a great tweet from Wes Bos:</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x1f525; A visual guide to getting equal width columns in CSS Grid <a href="https://t.co/PY4yYokY18">pic.twitter.com/PY4yYokY18</a></p>&mdash; Wes Bos (@wesbos) <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1256229763225657348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>I know a ton of people run into this — based on the number of emails I get about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/preventing-a-grid-blowout/">the grid blowout</a> article — so it&#8217;s worth kinda internalizing why all this is the way it is. It probably should be easier but I don&#8217;t have any particular suggestions on how it could be. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned <a href="https://css-tricks.com/exciting-things-on-the-horizon-for-css-layout/">this</a> the other day via Michelle Barker&#8217;s coverage, but here I&#8217;ll <a href="https://web.dev/flexbox-gap/">link to</a> the official announcement. The main thing is that we&#8217;ll be getting <code>gap</code> with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>, which means:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.flex-parent {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}
.flex-child {
  flex: 1;
}</code></pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I mentioned <a href="https://css-tricks.com/exciting-things-on-the-horizon-for-css-layout/">this</a> the other day via Michelle Barker&#8217;s coverage, but here I&#8217;ll <a href="https://web.dev/flexbox-gap/">link to</a> the official announcement. The main thing is that we&#8217;ll be getting <code>gap</code> with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>, which means:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.flex-parent {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}
.flex-child {
  flex: 1;
}</code></pre>



<p>That&#8217;s excellent, as putting space in between flex items has been tough in the past. We have <code>justify-content: space-between</code>, which is nice sometimes, but that doesn&#8217;t allow you to explicitly tell the flex container <em>how much</em> space you want. For that, we&#8217;d typically use <code>margin</code>, but that means <em>avoiding</em> setting the margin on the first or last element depending on the direction of the margin — which is annoying gets complicated. </p>



<p>We have <code>gap</code> in CSS Grid and it&#8217;s way better. It&#8217;s great to have it in flexbox.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s going to get weird for a minute. Safari doesn&#8217;t support it yet (nor stable Chrome) so we can&#8217;t just plop it out there and expect it to work with flexbox. But shouldn&#8217;t we be able to do an <code>@supports</code> query these days?</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* Nope, sorry. This "works" but it doesn't 
   actually tell you if it works in *flexbox* or not.
   This works in grid in most browsers now, so it will pass. */
@supports (gap: 1rem) {
  .flex-parent {
     gap: 1rem;
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>That got weird because <code>grid-gap</code> was dropped in favor of just <code>gap</code>. I&#8217;m sure <code>grid-gap</code> will be supported forever because that&#8217;s generally how these things go, but we&#8217;re encouraged to use <code>gap</code> instead. So, you might say gap is a little overloaded, but that should shake out over time (<em>a year?</em>). It&#8217;s complicated a smidge more by the fact that <code>column-gap</code> is now going to <code>gap</code> as well. <code>gap</code> has a whole bunch of jobs. </p>



<p>I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m still in favor of the change, despite the overloading. Simpler mental modals are important for the long-term, and there isn&#8217;t exactly anything coming up to challenge CSS for styling in the browser. I&#8217;d bet my 2-year old daughter writes some CSS in her lifetime.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s build a literal grid of squares, and we&#8217;ll put the logos of some magazines centered inside each square. I imagine plenty of you have had to build a logo grid before. You can probably already picture it: an area of a site that lists the donors, sponsors, or that is showing off all the big fancy companies that use some product. Putting the logos into squares is a decent way of handling it, as it forces some clean structure amongst logos that are all different sizes, aspect ratios, and visual weights, which can get finicky and look sloppy.</p>



<p>By &#8220;grid&#8221; I mean CSS grid. Setting up a grid of (flexible) squares is a little trick of its own. Then we&#8217;ll plop those logos in there in a way that keeps them sized and centered. At the end, we&#8217;ll look at one little oddity.</p>



<span id="more-306022"></span>



<h3>1) Grid markup</h3>



<p>Have you ever tried this in an editor that supports Emmet?</p>



<pre rel="" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid>div*5>img</code></pre>



<p>Then press <strong>tab</strong>. It will expand out into:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="grid">
  &lt;div>&lt;img src="" alt="">&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;img src="" alt="">&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;img src="" alt="">&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;img src="" alt="">&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;img src="" alt="">&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></code></pre>



<p>Just a little trick for working quickly.</p>



<h3>2) CSS Grid basics</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ll use the infamous flexible columns technique:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 1rem;
}</code></pre>



<p>That will give us not only flexible columns, but a flexible <em>number</em> of columns. Remember, we don&#8217;t really care how many columns there are — we&#8217;re just building a grid of logos to display. </p>



<p>If we give each of those grid item divs a background and a forced height, we&#8217;d see something like: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?fit=1024%2C330&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306023" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?w=1590&amp;ssl=1 1590w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?resize=300%2C97&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?resize=1024%2C330&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?resize=768%2C247&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?resize=1536%2C495&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.44.42-AM.png?resize=1000%2C322&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /><figcaption>This screenshot is at a parent width of about 800px. The three columns seen here will increase and decrease to fill the space, thanks to that grid magic.</figcaption></figure>



<h3>2) Making real squares</h3>



<p>Rather than force the grid items to any particular height, let&#8217;s use an aspect-ratio trick. We&#8217;ll plop an empty pseudo-element in there with <code>padding-bottom: 100%;</code> meaning it will force the height to be at least as tall as it is wide.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid > div {
  background: black;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.grid > div::before {
  content: "";
  padding-bottom: 100%;
  display: block;
}</code></pre>



<p>If we temporarily hide the images, you&#8217;ll see the grid of rectangles has become a grid of perfect squares:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?fit=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?w=1584&amp;ssl=1 1584w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?resize=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?resize=1536%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/squares.png?resize=1000%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<h3>3) Overlapping the Images</h3>



<p>But <em>with</em> the images in there, they grow a little oblong because the image sits in the pseudo-element.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?fit=1024%2C756&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306025" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?w=1584&amp;ssl=1 1584w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?resize=1024%2C756&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?resize=768%2C567&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?resize=1536%2C1135&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oblong.png?resize=1000%2C739&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ll need a way to sit them on top of one another. Usually, with aspect-ratio techniques, we reach for absolute positioning to place the in-child container to cover the now aspect-ratioed shape. But since we&#8217;re using grid already anyway, let&#8217;s use grid again to place the items into the same space:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid > div {
  /* ... */
  display: grid;
}
.grid > div::before,
.grid > div > img {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2;
}</code></pre>



<p>That says to make the grid items of the main grid also into grid containers, with no explicit rows and columns, then to place both the pseudo-element and image onto the first row and column of that grid. This will force them to overlap them, making a nice grid of squares again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?fit=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306026" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?w=1592&amp;ssl=1 1592w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?resize=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?resize=1536%2C1056&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/square-img.png?resize=1000%2C687&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<h3>4) Placing the images</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s plop a proper <code>src</code> in there for each image. If we make sure the images fill the space (and limit themselves) with <code>width: 100%</code>, we&#8217;ll see them along the top of the grid items:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?fit=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306027" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?w=1584&amp;ssl=1 1584w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?resize=1024%2C692&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?resize=768%2C519&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?resize=1536%2C1038&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/along-top.png?resize=1000%2C676&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Not terrible, but we would prefer to see them centered. Here&#8217;s one trick to do that. First, we&#8217;ll also make their <code>height: 100%</code>, which distorts them:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?fit=1024%2C687&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306028" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?w=1560&amp;ssl=1 1560w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?resize=1024%2C687&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?resize=1536%2C1030&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/distort.png?resize=1000%2C671&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>Then fix that up with <code>object-fit</code>!</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid > div > img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: contain;
}</code></pre>



<p>There we go:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?fit=1024%2C694&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-306029" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?w=1568&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?resize=1024%2C694&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?resize=768%2C520&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?resize=1536%2C1040&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-6.01.41-AM.png?resize=1000%2C677&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" /></figure>



<p>That will work responsively:</p>



<iframe src="https://player.cloudinary.com/embed/?cloud_name=css-tricks&amp;public_id=resp-logos_xq4ha0&amp;fluid=true&amp;controls=true&amp;show_jump_controls=false&amp;floating_when_not_visible=false&amp;hide_context_menu=false&amp;source_types%5B0%5D=mp4" width="1000" height="600" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<h3>5) Quirky dragging size</h3>



<p>This (probably) isn&#8217;t a massive deal, but notice how the logos look when you drag them off (like a user might if they are trying to save one):</p>



<iframe src="https://player.cloudinary.com/embed/?cloud_name=css-tricks&amp;public_id=drag-size_ovyrfd&amp;fluid=true&amp;controls=true&amp;show_jump_controls=false&amp;floating_when_not_visible=false&amp;hide_context_menu=false&amp;source_types%5B0%5D=mp4" width="1000" height="600" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p>The images look like they have <code>width: 100%; height: 100%;</code> without the <code>object-fit: contain;</code>. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the working demo so far, with that quirk:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_jOPdMNJ" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/jOPdMNJ?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=jOPdMNJ&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed jOPdMNJ" title="CodePen Embed jOPdMNJ" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<h3>6) Use absolute positioning instead</h3>



<p>If that dragging quirk is a big deal, we can always just absolutely position the images inside the grid children instead.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s one way, assuming the grid child div is <code>position: relative;</code>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid > div > img {
  position: absolute;
  max-width: 100%;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  left: 0;
  margin: auto;
}</code></pre>



<p>And here&#8217;s another:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.grid > div > img {
  position: absolute;
  max-width: 100%;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}</code></pre>



<p>Either of those fix that dragging quirk. Here&#8217;s a demo:</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_QWbojdO" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/QWbojdO?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=QWbojdO&amp;default-tab=result" height="550" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed QWbojdO" title="CodePen Embed QWbojdO" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Using CSS grid to make a grid, is, well, the whole point. But what if you want all those grid items to maintain an aspect ratio, like a 1:1 square? It&#8217;s possible, but it involves a little trickery. In this video, we&#8217;ll look at doing that because we want to put a logo, centered, in each square.</p>
